1. **What the code solves:**

The code solves the problem of **sorting a linked list containing only the values 0, 1, and 2** in non-decreasing order. This is a classic and well-known problem often called the "**Sort a Linked List of 0s, 1s and 2s**" or "Dutch National Flag problem on linked lists."

2. **Problem Description:**

You are given a singly linked list where each node contains an integer value that can only be 0, 1, or 2. Your task is to rearrange the nodes of the list such that all nodes containing 0 come first, followed by the nodes containing 1, and then the nodes containing 2. You must do this efficiently without changing node values (i.e., by rearranging the node pointers).

*This problem is common in data structures and algorithms interviews because it tests your understanding of linked lists, pointer manipulation, and efficient in-place sorting for constrained value sets.*

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0  
Output: 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2

Example 2 (edge case â€“ all same values):  
Input: 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2  
Output: 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2

Example 3 (single element):  
Input: 0  
Output: 0

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Create three dummy linked lists (sub-lists) to group nodes of values 0, 1, and 2 separately:
  - zeroHead & zeroTail for 0s
  - oneHead & oneTail for 1s
  - twoHead & twoTail for 2s

- Traverse the original list once and insert nodes into the appropriate sublist based on their value using the `insertAtTail` helper method.

- After the traversal, link the three sublists together:
  - Connect the 0s list to the 1s list if it exists, otherwise directly to the 2s list.
  - Connect the 1s list to the 2s list.
  - Terminate the final list with null.

- Remove the dummy head nodes and return the head of the rearranged list.

**Techniques:**  
- Using separate dummy nodes for cleaner sub-list creation.  
- Single pass traversal (O(n) time).  
- No extra space for array storage (O(1) auxiliary space apart from pointers).  

**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list, since each node is visited exactly once.  
**Space complexity:** O(1) (excluding space for output list) as the algorithm rearranges existing nodes without additional data storage proportional to n.

                twoTail = curr;

        }

        // Connect the three lists
        // If 1s list is not empty, connect 0s list to 1s list

            zeroTail.next = oneHead.next;

        System.out.print("Sorted List 1:   ");
        printList(sorted1);

        int[] arr2 = {2, 2, 2, 2};
        Node head2 = buildList(arr2);
        System.out.print("Original List 2: ");

This Java class defines the same logic as the given C++ code but follows Java conventions, avoids pointers by direct reference manipulation, and includes helper methods for testing. The `sortList` method is the core algorithm implementing the partitioning and merging steps to efficiently sort the linked list of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
