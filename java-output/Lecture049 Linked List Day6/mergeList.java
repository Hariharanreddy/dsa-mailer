1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code **merges two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted linked list**. This is a classic problem of merging two sorted sequences, but here implemented on linked lists.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**

*Given two singly linked lists where the nodes are sorted in ascending order, merge them into a single sorted linked list without creating new nodes or using extra memory (in-place merge). The resulting linked list should be sorted in ascending order.*

**Context:**  
This problem is fundamental in data structures and algorithms and frequently appears in interview questions and competitive programming. It underpins the merge step of the merge sort algorithm for linked lists and is useful in scenarios where data streams or sorted sequences must be combined efficiently.

3. **Examples:**

- *Example 1:*  
Input:  
List 1: 1 -> 3 -> 5  
List 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6  
Output:  
Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

- *Example 2 (Edge case: one empty list):*  
Input:  
List 1: (empty)  
List 2: 0 -> 7 -> 10  
Output:  
Merged List: 0 -> 7 -> 10

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- **Initialize** pointers to traverse both lists (`curr1` and `curr2`).
- The overall approach:
  - Ensure that the first list's head has the smaller first element (if not, swap the two lists).
  - Use two pointers for the first list (`curr1` and `next1`) and two pointers for the second list (`curr2` and `next2`).
  - Traverse both lists simultaneously:
    - Check if the current node from the second list (`curr2`) fits between `curr1` and `next1` nodes in the first list (i.e., lies between `curr1->data` and `next1->data`).
    - If yes, insert this node (`curr2`) from the second list between `curr1` and `next1`.
    - Advance pointers accordingly.
    - If no, move forward in the first list (`curr1` and `next1`) to find the right place.
- Continue until all nodes in the second list are merged.
- If the second list nodes remain after traversing, append the rest at the end.

**Pattern/Technique:** In-place merging of linked lists using pointer manipulation.

**Optimization/Gotchas:**  
- No new nodes are created; list nodes are re-linked in place, saving space.  
- The method reduces overhead of allocating new memory or copying data.  
- Ensuring the first list starts with the smaller element simplifies merging logic.  
- Proper handling when one list becomes empty first.

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two linked lists, since each list node is visited at most once.

        }
    }

        Node curr2 = second;
        Node next2 = null;

        // Traverse until either list ends
        while (next1 != null && curr2 != null) {
            // If curr2's data fits between curr1 and next1, insert curr2
            if (curr2.data >= curr1.data && curr2.data <= next1.data) {
                next2 = curr2.next;    // Save next node of second list

    // Utility method to print linked list

            temp = temp.next;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Example usage and testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
