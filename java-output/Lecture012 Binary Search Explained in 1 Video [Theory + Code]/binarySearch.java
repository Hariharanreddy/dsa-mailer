1. **What the Code Solves:**

The provided C++ snippet implements two fundamental **binary search** related algorithms:

- A **standard binary search** for locating a specific key in a sorted array.
- A **peak element finder** in an array (specifically for a "bitonic" or unimodal array).

2. **Problem Description:**

**Binary Search Problem:**

Given a sorted array and a target value (key), find the index of the key in the array. If the key doesn't exist, return -1.

*Context:* Binary Search is a classic and efficient searching algorithm with O(log n) time complexity, widely used in computer science for rapid searching in sorted structures. This is fundamental in interview settings and competitive programming.

**Peak Element Finder Problem:**

Given an array that first increases and then decreases (a bitonic array), find the index of the "peak" elementâ€”the maximum element where the array switches from increasing to decreasing.

*Context:* The problem of finding a peak is relevant in scenarios such as signal processing, optimization problems, or when searching for maxima in unimodal functions. It uses a variant of binary search to be efficient.

3. **Examples:**

**Binary Search:**

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18], key = 6  
Output: 2  
Explanation: 6 is found at index 2.

Example 2 (key not found):
Input: arr = [3, 8, 11, 14, 16], key = 10  
Output: -1  
Explanation: 10 is not in the array.

---

**Peak Element Finder:**

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1, 3, 7, 8, 12, 4, 2], n = 7  
Output: 4  
Explanation: arr[4] = 12 is the peak element.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [5, 10, 20, 15, 8, 6], n = 6  
Output: 2  
Explanation: arr[2] = 20 is the peak element.

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

**Binary Search:**

- Initialize two pointers: start = 0, end = array length - 1.
- Loop until start <= end:
  - Calculate mid (to avoid overflow: `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`).
  - If arr[mid] == key, return mid.
  - If key > arr[mid], move `start` to `mid + 1` (search right half).
  - Else, move `end` to `mid - 1` (search left half).
- If key is not found, return -1.

*Pattern:* Iterative binary search on sorted array.  
*Time Complexity:* O(log n).

---

**Peak Element Finder:**

- Initialize pointers: s = 0, e = n - 1.
- While s < e:
  - Compute mid.
  - Check if arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]:
    - If true, peak must be in right half, so s = mid + 1.
    - Else, peak lies in left half or at mid, so e = mid.
- At the end, s == e points to the peak element index.
  
*Pattern:* Binary search variant exploiting the property of bitonic arrays.  
*Time Complexity:* O(log n).

*Gotchas:*  
- The array must have a peak (unimodal - strictly increasing then decreasing).  
- Carefully handle mid calculation to prevent overflow.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

```java
public class BinarySearchAndPeakFinder {

    // Performs binary search on a sorted array to find the key.
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int key) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        while (start <= end) {
            // Avoid overflow for large indices
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == key) {
                return mid;
            }

            if (key > arr[mid]) {
                start = mid + 1; // Search right half
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;   // Search left half
            }
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    // Finds the index of the peak element in a bitonic array.
    public static int findPeak(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        // Binary search for peak element
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            // If element at mid is less than element at mid+1,
            // peak lies in right half
            if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Else peak lies in left half including mid
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start; // start == end is the peak index
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] evenArr = {2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18};
        int[] oddArr = {3, 8, 11, 14, 16};

        int evenIndex = binarySearch(evenArr, 6);
        System.out.println("Index of 6 is " + evenIndex); // Expected: 2

        int oddIndex = binarySearch(oddArr, 14);
        System.out.println("Index of 14 is " + oddIndex); // Expected: 3

        int[] bitonicArr1 = {1, 3, 7, 8, 12, 4, 2};
        int peakIndex1 = findPeak(bitonicArr1);
        System.out.println("Peak index in bitonicArr1 is " + peakIndex1); // Expected: 4

        int[] bitonicArr2 = {5, 10, 20, 15, 8, 6};
        int peakIndex2 = findPeak(bitonicArr2);
        System.out.println("Peak index in bitonicArr2 is " + peakIndex2); // Expected: 2
    }
}
