1. **What the Code Solves:**

This code demonstrates **printing numbers from 1 to n using recursion**. It addresses the basic concept of *recursion* in Data Structures and Algorithms by printing integers in ascending order without using loops.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:** Given a positive integer \( n \), print all numbers from 1 up to \( n \) inclusive, each on a new line, using a recursive algorithm without using any iterative constructs (such as loops).

**Context:**  
This is a classic introductory recursion problem often seen in both academic and interview settings. Its purpose is to help students understand how recursive functions work — specifically, how recursive calls can simulate iterative behavior, and how base cases prevent infinite recursion. Learning this helps in understanding more complex recursive and divide-and-conquer algorithms widely used in computer science and competitive programming.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1 (Typical scenario):**  
Input:  
5  
Output:  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  

**Example 2 (Edge case - smallest input):**  
Input:  
1  
Output:  
1  

**Example 3 (Edge case - zero input):**  
Input:  
0  
Output:  
(no output)  
Explanation: Since \( n = 0 \), the base case is triggered immediately, so no numbers are printed.

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- **Base Case:** When \( n = 0 \), stop recursion by returning immediately; no number is printed.
- **Recursive Case:** For any \( n > 0 \):
  - First, recursively call the function with parameter \( n-1 \).
  - After the recursive call returns, print the current value \( n \).
- **Order Preservation:** Because the recursive call is made *before* printing \( n \), the numbers get printed from 1 up to \( n \), not the other way around.
- **Technique Used:** Recursion with a base case and a recursive call, replicating simple iteration.
- **Optimization/Gotchas:**  
  - For very large \( n \), recursion depth may cause stack overflow in some environments.
  - No loops are used; all repetition is via recursion.

**Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) — the function is called recursively \(n\) times, each call does \(O(1)\) work.

5. **Java Conversion:**

public class PrintNumbersRecursively {

    // Recursive method to print numbers from 1 to n
    private static void print(int n) {
        // Base case: if n is 0, stop recursion
        if (n == 0) {
            return;
        }

        // Recursive call with n-1 to print smaller numbers first
        print(n - 1);

        // Print current number after the smaller numbers
        System.out.println(n);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a positive integer: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println(); // Blank line before output

        print(n);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
