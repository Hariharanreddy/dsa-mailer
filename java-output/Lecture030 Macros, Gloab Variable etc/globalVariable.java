The given C++ code snippet does **not** implement a classical Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem. Instead, it demonstrates concepts related to **global variables, passing variables by reference, and function calls**. The key focus is on how a global variable's state changes and how reference parameters behave across function calls.

---

**1. What the Code Solves:**

This code illustrates **the behavior of a global variable and pass-by-reference parameter passing** in C++, particularly how changes to a global variable persist across function calls and how passing by reference allows functions to affect the original argument.

---

**2. Problem Description:**

Given a global integer variable initialized with a value, two functions `a` and `b` accept an integer by reference and print the global variable along with the passed integer. Function `a` modifies the global variable. We want to observe and understand:

- How the global variable's value changes before and after function calls.
- How passing by reference lets the functions read the original variable value.
- The order of output when calling these functions from `main`.

This exercise helps students understand **global state**, **pass-by-reference semantics**, and **function call side effects** in procedural programming. It also provides a basic foundation before exploring more complex DSA problems.

**3. Examples:**

Example 1 (Given in code):

Input: (Implicit in code)
- Global variable `score` = 15
- Local integer `i = 5`

Output:
```
15 in main
15 in a
5
16 in b
5
```

Explanation:
- `main` prints global `score` 15.
- `a` prints `score` 15, then increments it to 16, then prints `i`.
- `b` prints updated `score` 16, then prints `i`.

Example 2 (If `score` starts at 0 and `i` is 10):

Output:
```
0 in main
0 in a
10
1 in b
10
```

---

**4. Explanation of Logic:**

- `score` is a global variable initialized to 15.
- In `main`, the current `score` is printed.
- An integer `i` initialized with 5 is declared.
- `a(i)` is called. Inside `a`:
  - Print the current `score`.
  - Increment `score` by 1 (side effect on global state).
  - Print `i`.
- `b(i)` is called. Inside `b`:
  - Print the updated `score` (reflecting modification by `a`).
  - Print `i`.
- Because `i` is passed by reference, the original `i` is used in the called functions.
- Global `score` changes are visible inside all functions.

**Key Concepts:**

- Global variable persistence through function calls.
- Pass-by-reference: changes to the variable inside the function will affect the caller's variable (though here `i` is only read).
- Side effects on global state can affect subsequent function behavior.
- Printing demonstrates the order of execution and values at each stage.

**Time Complexity:** The code runs in O(1) time since it just performs a fixed number of operations with no iterations.

**5. Java Conversion:**

Java does not allow passing primitives by reference directly. To simulate pass-by-reference for primitive `int` in Java, we can use a mutable wrapper class like `AtomicInteger` or create a simple wrapper class. Also, Java supports static variables similar to C++ global variables.

Here is the Java equivalent with clear comments and runnable structure:

```java
public class GlobalVariableDemo {
    // Static variable simulates global variable 'score'
    private static int score = 15;

    // Method 'a' takes a mutable wrapper for integer to simulate pass-by-reference
    public static void a(IntWrapper i) {
        System.out.println(score + " in a");
        score++; // Increment global score
        System.out.println(i.value);
    }

    // Method 'b' to print score and the integer value passed by reference
    public static void b(IntWrapper i) {
        System.out.println(score + " in b");
        System.out.println(i.value);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(score + " in main");
        IntWrapper i = new IntWrapper(5);
        a(i);
        b(i);
    }
}

// Helper class to simulate pass-by-reference for int
class IntWrapper {
    public int value;

    public IntWrapper(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `score` is declared `static` to simulate C++ global.
- `IntWrapper` encapsulates an integer to simulate pass-by-reference semantics.
- `a` and `b` print `score` and `i.value`, `a` increments `score`.
- `main` initializes `score`, wraps `i` into `IntWrapper`, and calls the methods similarly to the C++ program.
- Output matches the C++ code, demonstrating global variable changes and parameter pass-by-reference effects.
