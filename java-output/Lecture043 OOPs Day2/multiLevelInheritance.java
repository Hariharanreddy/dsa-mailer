1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code demonstrates **basic class inheritance and method invocation** in object-oriented programming. It shows how subclasses inherit properties and methods from superclasses and how a method defined in the base class can be used by objects of derived classes. This addresses the concept of **inheritance in object-oriented design**, a fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and programming concept.

2. **Problem Description:**

Explain how **inheritance** enables the reuse of code and defines an "is-a" relationship between classes. Given a base class `Animal` with some properties and a method, and derived classes `Dog` and `GermanShepherd` extending it, demonstrate how an object of the most derived class can access the base class method without redefining it.

This concept is vital in software engineering and competitive programming alike, as it underpins polymorphism and code modularity.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 — Typical case:
```
Input: Create an object of class GermanShepherd and invoke speak()
Output:
Speaking
```

Example 2 — Edge case (no override):
```
Input: Create an object of Dog and invoke speak()
Output:
Speaking
```

The second example shows that even without overriding, the derived class inherits the method from `Animal`.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Define a base class `Animal`, which has attributes like `age` and `weight`, and a method `speak()`.
- Create a class `Dog` that publicly inherits from `Animal` but does not add new members.
- Create a class `GermanShepherd` which inherits from `Dog`.
- Instantiate an object of `GermanShepherd`.
- Call the inherited method `speak()` on the `GermanShepherd` object.
- The method call uses the version from `Animal` since subclasses didn’t override it.
- This shows **simple inheritance and method accessibility across class hierarchies**.
- No recursion or complex algorithms are involved; it's a straightforward inheritance demonstration.
- Time complexity is O(1) for method call as no loops or recursion occur.

5. **Java Code Equivalent:**

public class InheritanceExample {

    // Base class Animal
    static class Animal {
        int age;
        int weight;

        // Method speaks
        public void speak() {
            System.out.println("Speaking");
        }
    }

    // Derived class Dog extends Animal
    static class Dog extends Animal {
        // No extra members or methods
    }

    // Derived class GermanShepherd extends Dog
    static class GermanShepherd extends Dog {
        // No extra members or methods
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate GermanShepherd object
        GermanShepherd g = new GermanShepherd();

        // Call inherited method speak()
        g.speak();
    }
}
