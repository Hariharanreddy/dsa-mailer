1. **What the Code Solves:**

The provided C++ code demonstrates the concept of *multiple inheritance* and how to resolve ambiguity in method calls arising from it.

2. **Problem Description:**

In object-oriented programming, a class can inherit properties and methods from one or more parent classes—a concept known as inheritance. When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called *multiple inheritance*. If the parent classes have methods with the same name, calling that method on the child class leads to ambiguity. This problem asks you to understand how to handle this ambiguity explicitly.

**Problem Statement:**  
Given two parent classes `A` and `B`, each having a method `func()`, and a child class `C` that inherits from both, demonstrate how to invoke each parent's `func()` method from an object of class `C` to resolve ambiguity.

This problem is relevant in understanding fundamental object-oriented programming concepts, especially how languages like C++ handle multiple inheritance and name conflicts. It's a good example for interviews or competitive programming to test knowledge on inheritance and scope resolution.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input: Create an object of class C, call `func()`  
Output: (Since calling `func()` directly is ambiguous, code must specify which parent’s `func()` is called.)

Example 2:  
Input: Create object `obj` of `C`, execute `obj.A::func(); obj.B::func();`  
Output:  
```
I am A
I am B
```

Example 3 (Edge Case):  
Try calling `obj.func()` directly (commented out in code).  
Output: Compilation error due to ambiguity (both `A` and `B` have `func()`).

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Classes `A` and `B` both define a method named `func()`.
- Class `C` inherits publicly from both `A` and `B` (`class C : public A, public B`), thereby acquiring both `func()` methods.
- Calling `func()` on an object of `C` directly is ambiguous because the compiler cannot decide whether to call `A::func()` or `B::func()`.
- To resolve this ambiguity, the code uses the scope resolution operator `::` specifying which parent’s method to invoke:
  - `obj.A::func();` calls `func()` defined in class `A`.
  - `obj.B::func();` calls `func()` defined in class `B`.
- This use of fully qualified naming (scope resolution operator) is necessary in multiple inheritance when methods have the same name.

**Key concepts:**  
*Multiple inheritance, ambiguity resolution, scope resolution operator.*

**Time complexity:**  
The code executes simple function calls without any loops or recursion. The time complexity is O(1).

5. **Java Conversion:**

Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes but allows multiple inheritance through interfaces. Because `A` and `B` have concrete method implementations, Java requires a different approach, such as using interfaces with default methods or class composition.

To replicate this example, we can use interfaces with default methods `func()` in Java 8+, then implement both interfaces in class `C`. To resolve ambiguity, `C` must override `func()` and explicitly specify which interface’s default method to call.

Below is a clean Java class demonstrating the concept and resolving ambiguity:

```java
public class MultipleInheritanceDemo {

    interface A {
        default void func() {
            System.out.println("I am A");
        }
    }

    interface B {
        default void func() {
            System.out.println("I am B");
        }
    }

    static class C implements A, B {
        // Override func() to resolve ambiguity
        @Override
        public void func() {
            // Call A's func()
            A.super.func();
            // Call B's func()
            B.super.func();
        }

        // If needed, separate calls to each parent's func
        public void funcFromA() {
            A.super.func();
        }

        public void funcFromB() {
            B.super.func();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();

        // Calls overridden func(), which calls both A and B
        obj.func();

        // Or call them separately
        obj.funcFromA();
        obj.funcFromB();
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Java code:**  
- Interfaces `A` and `B` each have a default method `func()`.  
- Class `C` implements both interfaces, so it is forced to override `func()` to resolve conflict.  
- Inside overridden `func()`, calls to each interface's `func()` are done via `InterfaceName.super.func()`.  
- Separate methods allow explicitly calling each parent's `func()` individually.  
- The `main` method demonstrates usage.

This Java solution respects language constraints while illustrating the same core concept — resolving method ambiguity due to multiple inheritance.
