## 1. **Explanation: What Does the Code Solve?**

The code implements a **recursive linear search** to determine if a specific key exists within an array. The core DSA concept here is **linear search**—one of the simplest search algorithms—applied recursively to traverse the array element by element.

## 2. **Problem Statement**

**Given an array of integers and a target value, write a function that checks whether the target is present in the array. Use recursion to implement your solution. The function should return true if the key is found, and false otherwise. Print the array at each recursive step for educational purposes.**

**Context:**  
This problem is foundational for learning recursion and search algorithms. While less efficient than binary search for sorted arrays, linear search is conceptually important and frequently used in contexts where data is not sorted or when simplicity is valued over performance (e.g., in small datasets or when implementing other algorithms).

## 3. **Examples**

**Example 1: Key Present**
```
Input:  arr = [3, 5, 1, 2, 6], key = 6
Output: Present
```
**Trace Output:**
```
Size of array is 5
3 5 1 2 6 
Size of array is 4
5 1 2 6 
Size of array is 3
1 2 6 
Size of array is 2
2 6 
Size of array is 1
6 
```
**Example 2: Key Absent**
```
Input:  arr = [3, 5, 1, 2, 6], key = 0
Output: absent
```
**Trace Output:**
```
Size of array is 5
3 5 1 2 6 
Size of array is 4
5 1 2 6 
Size of array is 3
1 2 6 
Size of array is 2
2 6 
Size of array is 1
6
Size of array is 0
```

## 4. **Logic Description**

- **Base Case:** If the array size is 0, return false: the element was not found.
- **Recursive Step:** If the first element is equal to the key, return true. Otherwise, slice the array (pass the rest of the array and the updated size) and recurse.
- **Printing:** Each recursive call prints the current slice of the array being searched.
- **Patterns:** This uses **recursion** to implement a **linear search**, which works by checking each element in sequence.
- **Optimizations:** No explicit array slicing is needed in C++, but the logic is naturally recursive. In Java, array slicing is not efficient, so we pass the entire array and the current index.
- **Gotchas:** Recursion can lead to a call stack overflow with very large arrays.
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) for both best and worst case (must check every element if not found), where \(n\) is the array length.

## 5. **Java Conversion**

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class RecursiveLinearSearch {

    // Prints the current slice of the array
    private static void print(int[] arr, int start, int size) {
        System.out.print("Size of array is " + size + "\n");
        for (int i = start; i < start + size && i < arr.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Recursive linear search
    public static boolean linearSearch(int[] arr, int size, int start, int key) {
        print(arr, start, size);
        // Base case
        if (size == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (arr[start] == key) {
            return true;
        } else {
            // Recursive call: search in the rest of the array
            return linearSearch(arr, size - 1, start + 1, key);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {3, 5, 1, 2, 6};
        int size = 5;
        int key = 6; // Try with key = 0 for not found case
        boolean ans = linearSearch(arr, size, 0, key);

        if (ans) {
            System.out.println("Present");
        } else {
            System.out.println("absent");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Java-Specific Adaptations**
- **No Array Slicing:** Java does not support easy pointer arithmetic or array slicing as C++ does. Instead, we pass the original array along with `start` and `size` parameters to indicate the current window being searched[3].
- **Best Practices:** The main method uses standard Java I/O, and the class is self-contained.
- **Comments:** The method is well-commented, and the recursive logic is clear.
- **Ready to Run:** This class can be copied and run in any Java environment.
