1. **What the Code Solves:**
The code prints a right-aligned half-pyramid pattern of stars given an input number of rows. This is a classic pattern-printing problem often used to teach nested loops and practice basic output formatting.

2. **Problem Statement:**
Given a positive integer \( n \), print a right-aligned triangular pattern of stars with \( n \) rows. The first row contains 1 star, the second row 2 stars, and so forth, until the \( n^{th} \) row, which contains \( n \) stars. Each row should be right-aligned, meaning spaces are used on the left so that the stars appear aligned to the right margin.

*Context:* This problem is fundamental in learning how to manipulate loops and output formatting, commonly appearing in beginner programming challenges and interview preparation. It helps understand nested loops, printing spaces vs. characters conditionally, and output alignment.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical Case):  
Input: 4  
Output:
```
   *
  **
 ***
****
```

Example 2 (Edge Case - Minimum Input):  
Input: 1  
Output:
```
*
```

Example 3 (Larger Input):  
Input: 6  
Output:
```
     *
    **
   ***
  ****
 *****
******
```

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Loop through each row from 1 to \( n \):
  - Calculate the number of spaces for the current row as \( n - \text{row} \).
  - Print that many spaces on the left to achieve right alignment.
  - Then print stars equal to the current row number.
- Print a newline after each row is printed.
- This uses **nested loops**: an outer loop for rows and inner loops for spaces and stars.
- The key pattern is controlling the balance of spaces and stars on each line.
- The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), since for each of the \(n\) rows, up to \(n\) characters (spaces + stars) are printed.

5. **Java Code:**

public class RightAlignedStarPattern {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        // Loop through each row
        for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {
            // Print spaces for right alignment
            for (int space = 0; space < n - row; space++) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            // Print stars for the current row
            for (int star = 0; star < row; star++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            // Move to next line after printing stars
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
