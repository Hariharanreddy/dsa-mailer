1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code simply prints an \( n \times n \) square pattern where each row contains numbers in descending order starting from \( n \) down to 1. It is a classic pattern printing problem often used to practice nested loops.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Print a square numeric pattern of size \( n \times n \) where each row consists of numbers from \( n \) down to 1.**

**Detailed statement:**  
Given a positive integer \( n \), print \( n \) rows. Each row should contain \( n \) numbers starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 1 in each subsequent number. This problem tests understanding of nested loops and basic pattern output formatting.

**Context:**  
Pattern printing is a common beginner-level problem in data structures and algorithms practice. It helps in developing logic for loop control, indexing, and output formatting, skills essential in competitive programming and technical interviews.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
3  
Output:  
3 2 1  
3 2 1  
3 2 1  

**Example 2 (Edge Case):**  
Input:  
1  
Output:  
1

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- The outer loop runs from 1 to \( n \), iterating over each row.
- For each row, the inner loop runs from 1 to \( n \) to print the numbers in that row.
- Each element printed is \( n - j + 1 \), where \( j \) is the current column index — this produces descending numbers starting from \( n \).
- After printing all numbers in a row, move to the next line.
- The complexity is \( O(n^2) \) since the nested loops iterate over \( n \times n \) elements.

**Key points:**  
- The problem uses simple nested loops.  
- No complex data structures or recursion needed.  
- It’s important to get the indexing formula right to print descending numbers.

5. **Java Code:**

public class DescendingPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Read the input size n
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        
        // Outer loop for rows
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Inner loop for columns
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                // Print descending number: n - j + 1
                System.out.print((n - j + 1) + " ");
            }
            // Move to the next line after each row
            System.out.println();
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
