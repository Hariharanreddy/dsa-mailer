1. **What the Code Solves:**
The given C++ snippet prints a pattern of numbers forming a right-angled triangle where each row starts with the current row number and increments by 1 for each column. This is a classic pattern printing problem in data structures and algorithms (DSA).

2. **Problem Statement:**
Write a program that takes a positive integer \( n \) as input and prints \( n \) rows of numbers. Each row \( i \) should contain \( i \) numbers starting from \( i \) itself and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent number in the same row.

This type of pattern problem is common in coding interviews and helps evaluate understanding of nested loops, iteration control, and output formatting.

3. **Examples:**

Input:
3

Output:
1  
23  
345  

Explanation:  
- Row 1 prints 1 number starting from 1: "1"  
- Row 2 prints 2 numbers starting from 2: "2 3"  
- Row 3 prints 3 numbers starting from 3: "3 4 5"

---

Input:
5

Output:
1  
23  
345  
4567  
56789  

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**
- Use a loop to iterate over each row from 1 to \( n \).
- For each row \( i \):
  - Initialize a variable `value` to the row number \( i \).
  - Use an inner loop to print exactly \( i \) numbers.
  - For each column, print the current `value` and then increment `value` by 1.
- Move to the next line after printing all columns in the current row.

**Key points:**  
- Nested loops control rows and columns.  
- The `value` variable dynamically tracks the number printed at each position.  
- This is a straightforward pattern printing problem with time complexity \( O(n^2) \) because we print a total of \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) numbers.

5. **Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the number of rows
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        
        // Iterate through each row
        for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {
            int value = row;  // Starting number for the current row
            
            // Print numbers in the current row
            for (int col = 1; col <= row; col++) {
                System.out.print(value);
                value++;  // Increment the value for next number in the row
            }
            
            System.out.println();  // Move to the next line after each row
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java code closely follows the original C++ logic with idiomatic Java practices: use of `Scanner` for input, meaningful variable names, and structured comments for clarity.
