1. **What the Code Solves:**
The provided C++ code prints a pattern of numbers where each line starts from the line number and counts down to 1. This problem is essentially a **pattern printing problem**, often seen in basic programming and DSA fundamentals.

2. **Problem Description:**
Given an integer \( n \), print a pattern of \( n \) lines such that on the \( i^{th} \) line, you print numbers starting from \( i \) down to 1 separated by spaces. This task tests your understanding of nested loops and basic output formatting. Such pattern problems are common in beginner-level programming exercises and interviews, serving as practice for controlling loops and understanding iterative logic.

3. **Examples:**
- Example 1:
```
Input:
5
Output:
1
2 1
3 2 1
4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
```
- Example 2 (edge case, smallest input):
```
Input:
1
Output:
1
```

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**
- The outer loop runs from 1 to \( n \) (each iteration represents a line).
- The inner loop prints, for line \( i \), the numbers starting at \( i \) down to 1.
- To print numbers descending from \( i \) to 1, the inner loop iterates \( j \) from 1 to \( i \), and prints the number \( i - j + 1 \).
- After printing each line, move to the next line.
- This technique involves **nested loops** and simple arithmetic to generate the values.
- Time complexity is **O(nÂ²)** because for each line \( i \), up to \( i \) numbers are printed, summing to \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

5. **Java Code:**

public class NumberPattern {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.close();
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      // Print numbers from i down to 1 on the ith line
      for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        System.out.print((i - j + 1) + " ");
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
  }
}
