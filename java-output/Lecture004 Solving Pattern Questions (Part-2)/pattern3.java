1. **What the Code Solves:**

The code prints a **pattern printing problem**, specifically the pattern of repeated row numbers in a right-angled triangle form. This is a basic introductory problem in loops and patterns commonly found in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) exercises.

2. **Problem Description:**

Write a program that, given an integer \( n \), prints \( n \) rows where the \( i^{th} \) row contains the digit \( i \) repeated \( i \) times. This problem helps students practice nested loops and understand how to control iteration for pattern outputs. Such exercises are frequently used in competitive programming and coding interviews to test understanding of loops and simple output formatting.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical case):

Input:
```
n = 5
```

Output:
```
1
22
333
4444
55555
```

Example 2 (Edge case: smallest input):

Input:
```
n = 1
```

Output:
```
1
```

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- Use an outer loop that runs from 1 to n (each value representing the current row).
- Inside the outer loop, run an inner loop also from 1 up to the current row number.
- In the inner loop, print the current row number (i) without newline.
- After the inner loop completes, print a newline to move to the next row.
- The problem demonstrates nested looping and basic output formatting.
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \), since for each row \( i \), it prints \( i \) elements, totaling \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) prints.

5. **Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the number of rows
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        // Outer loop for rows
        for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {
            // Inner loop to print the row number 'row' times
            for (int col = 1; col <= row; col++) {
                System.out.print(row);
            }

            // Move to next line after printing each row
            System.out.println();
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program mimics the exact logic of the C++ code with clear structure, meaningful variable names, and Java conventions.
