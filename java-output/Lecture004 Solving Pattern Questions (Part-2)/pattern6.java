1. **What the code solves:**

This C++ code prints a square pattern of characters where each row contains the same uppercase letter starting from 'A' for the first row, 'B' for the second, and so on, repeating the letter for every column in that row.

It addresses a basic **pattern printing** problem in data structures and algorithms focused on loops and character arithmetic.

2. **Problem description:**

**Problem statement:**  
Given an integer \( n \), print an \( n \times n \) grid such that the first row contains 'A' repeated \( n \) times, the second row contains 'B' repeated \( n \) times, and so on, incrementing the character by one for each subsequent row.

**Context:**  
Pattern printing problems like this are common in *beginner programming courses*, *coding interviews*, and *competitive programming*. They test your understanding of loops, ASCII character operations, and nested iteration.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1 (typical):**  
Input: 3  
Output:  
AAA  
BBB  
CCC  

**Example 2 (edge case - smallest input):**  
Input: 1  
Output:  
A  

4. **Logic explanation:**

- Use two nested loops: the outer loop iterates over rows (from 1 to \( n \)), and the inner loop iterates over columns (from 1 to \( n \)).
- For each row, determine the character to print by starting from 'A' (ASCII 65) and adding the row index minus 1.
- Print this character \( n \) times in each row.
- Move to the next line after each row.
- This uses simple loops and ASCII arithmetic to generate the character sequence.
- **Time complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) because you print \( n \) characters \( n \) times.

5. **Java code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CharacterPattern {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        // Outer loop for rows
        for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {
            // Calculate the character for the current row
            char ch = (char) ('A' + row - 1);

            // Inner loop for printing characters in a row
            for (int col = 1; col <= n; col++) {
                System.out.print(ch);
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to next line after each row
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program directly mirrors the C++ logic, uses clear variable naming, and includes comments to explain steps. It uses `Scanner` for input and standard output for printing the pattern.
