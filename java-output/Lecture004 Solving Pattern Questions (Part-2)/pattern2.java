1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code prints a square matrix of size *n x n* filled with consecutive integers starting from 1, arranged row-wise. It solves the problem of *printing a matrix with numbers in sequence*.

---

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an integer \( n \), print an \( n \times n \) matrix such that the matrix contains integers from 1 to \( n^2 \) filled in row-major order. That is, numbers fill each row from left to right, then move to the next row below.

**Context and Relevance:**  
This is a basic problem often used in programming interviews and competitive programming to test understanding of nested loops, matrix traversal, and sequence generation. Such patterns build a foundation for more complex matrix manipulation problems.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
```
n = 3
```

Output:  
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

**Example 2 (Edge Case):**  
Input:  
```
n = 1
```

Output:  
```
1
```

Here, the smallest matrix simply prints "1".

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- Initialize a counter to 1.
- Use an outer loop to iterate over rows from 1 to \( n \).
- Inside, use an inner loop to iterate over columns from 1 to \( n \).
- For every cell, print the current counter value and increment the counter.
- After completing a row, print a newline to start the next row.
- This straightforward two-level nested loop approach generates the matrix in *row-major order*.

**Pattern/Technique:**  
- Nested loops for matrix traversal.
- Sequential number generation and printing.

**Optimization & Gotchas:**  
- No complex data structures or memory used; it runs in \( O(n^2) \) time which is optimal since every cell must be printed.
- Watch out for the end of line after each row.

**Time Complexity:**  
The solution runs in **O(nÂ²)** since it prints \( n^2 \) elements.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

public class SequentialMatrixPrinter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the size of the matrix
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        int count = 1;

        // Loop through each row
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Loop through each column in the current row
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                System.out.print(count + " ");
                count++;
            }
            // Move to next line after each row
            System.out.println();
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
