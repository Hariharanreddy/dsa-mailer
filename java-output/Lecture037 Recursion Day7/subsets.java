1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code generates **all possible subsets (the power set) of a given integer array**. This corresponds to the classical "Subsets" problem in Data Structures and Algorithms.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given a set (or array) of distinct integers, generate all possible subsets of the set, including the empty set and the set itself.

This problem is fundamental in algorithm design and appears often in coding interviews and competitive programming. It tests understanding of **backtracking** or **recursion**, as well as exploring combinatorial possibilities.

**Problem Statement for Students/Interview Prep:**

"Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order."

**Relevance:**

- Finding subsets is useful in problems around combinations, bit masking, solving constraint satisfaction problems.
- It is a common interview question to test recursive reasoning and backtracking.
- Commonly used in problems like subset sum, combinational sums, and in decision-making algorithms.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical):

Input: nums = [1,2]

Output:
[
  [],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2]
]

Example 2 (Edge case: empty input):

Input: nums = []

Output:
[
  []
]

Example 3 (Another typical):

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output:
[
  [],
  [1],
  [2],
  [3],
  [1,2],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2,3]
]

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Use **recursion/backtracking** to explore every element's inclusion or exclusion in the current subset.

- At each recursive call for index `i` in array:
  - First, recurse excluding `nums[i]` (i.e., current subset unchanged).
  - Then, include `nums[i]` into current subset and recurse.

- When the recursion index reaches beyond the last element, add the current subset (`output`) to the answer list.

- This effectively explores a decision tree of 2^n nodes where n is the input size. Each element has 2 choices: include or exclude.

- The recursion builds all possible subsets from empty to full set.

- **Time Complexity:** O(2^n * n), because there are 2^n subsets and copying subsets to the answer can take up to O(n) time each.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

public class Solution {

    /** Helper recursive method to generate subsets */
    private void solve(int[] nums, 
                       java.util.List<Integer> output, 
                       int index, 
                       java.util.List<java.util.List<Integer>> ans) {
        // Base case: If index is beyond last element, add a copy of current subset
        if (index == nums.length) {
            ans.add(new java.util.ArrayList<>(output));
            return;
        }
        
        // Exclude current element and move to next
        solve(nums, output, index + 1, ans);
        
        // Include current element and move to next
        output.add(nums[index]);
        solve(nums, output, index + 1, ans);
        
        // Backtrack - remove last element before returning to previous state
        output.remove(output.size() - 1);
    }
    
    /** Public method to return all subsets */
    public java.util.List<java.util.List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        java.util.List<java.util.List<Integer>> ans = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
        java.util.List<Integer> output = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
        solve(nums, output, 0, ans);
        return ans;
    }
    
    /** Main method to test the subsets function */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2};
        System.out.println("Subsets of [1, 2]: " + sol.subsets(nums1));
        
        int[] nums2 = {};
        System.out.println("Subsets of []: " + sol.subsets(nums2));
        
        int[] nums3 = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println("Subsets of [1, 2, 3]: " + sol.subsets(nums3));
    }
