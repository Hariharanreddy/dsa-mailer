1. **What the code solves:**

The C++ code generates *all subsequences* (also called subsets) of a given string excluding the empty subsequence. This is a classic *subsequence generation* or *power set* problem from combinatorics and recursion in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

2. **Problem statement:**

*Given a string, find and return a list of all possible subsequences of the string (i.e., all sequences that can be derived by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters), excluding the empty subsequence.*

This problem is fundamental for understanding recursion, backtracking, and subset generation techniques. It often appears in competitive programming, string manipulation tasks, and problems involving combinatorial enumeration.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:
Input: `"abc"`
Output: `["a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]`

Explanation: All subsequences except the empty one. They include single characters and combinations preserving order.

Example 2:
Input: `"a"`
Output: `["a"]`

Explanation: Only one subsequence possible (besides empty), which is the string itself.

4. **Solution logic:**

- Use *recursion* to explore each character's choice:
  - At each index, you have two choices:
    1. **Exclude** the current character and move to the next index.
    2. **Include** the current character and move to the next index.
- Keep track of the current subsequence string (`output`) built so far.
- When the index reaches the length of the string (base case), if the current subsequence (`output`) is not empty, add it to the answer list.
- This approach generates all subsequences by exploring the complete recursion tree of inclusion/exclusion.
- *Patterns/Techniques:* Recursion, Backtracking, Subset Enumeration.
- *Optimization:* This approach already takes minimum space needed to store results. The time complexity is \(O(2^n)\) since each character has two choices and every subsequence is generated.

5. **Time Complexity:**

- \(O(2^n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input string (all subsequences).
- Each recursion step branches into two calls.

6. **Java implementation:**

public class SubsequencesGenerator {

    // Recursive helper method to generate subsequences
    private static void solve(java.util.List<String> ans, String str, StringBuilder output, int index) {
        // Base case: reached end of string
        if (index >= str.length()) {
            if (output.length() > 0) {
                ans.add(output.toString());
            }
            return;
        }

        // Exclude current character and move forward
        solve(ans, str, output, index + 1);

        // Include current character and move forward
        output.append(str.charAt(index));
        solve(ans, str, output, index + 1);

        // Backtrack: remove last character added
        output.deleteCharAt(output.length() - 1);
    }

    // Method to return list of all subsequences excluding empty string
    public static java.util.List<String> subsequences(String str) {
        java.util.List<String> ans = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        solve(ans, str, output, 0);
        return ans;
    }

    // Main method to test the code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input1 = "abc";
        System.out.println("Subsequences of \"" + input1 + "\": " + subsequences(input1));

        String input2 = "a";
        System.out.println("Subsequences of \"" + input2 + "\": " + subsequences(input2));
    }
}
