1. **What the Code Solves:**
   The C++ code implements an algorithm to find the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two integers using the iterative subtraction-based Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Problem Description:**
   Given two non-negative integers **a** and **b**, the task is to find their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both **a** and **b** without leaving a remainder. This problem is fundamental in number theory with applications in simplifying fractions, cryptography, and algorithm optimization. It frequently appears in competitive programming and technical interviews.

3. **Examples:**

   Example 1 (Typical Case):
   ```
   Input: a = 48, b = 18
   Output: 6
   Explanation: 6 is the largest number that divides both 48 and 18.
   ```

   Example 2 (Edge Case):
   ```
   Input: a = 0, b = 5
   Output: 5
   Explanation: The GCD of 0 and a non-zero number is the non-zero number itself.
   ```

4. **Solution Logic:**
   - If either input is zero, the GCD is the other number (since any number divides zero).
   - Otherwise, use the Euclidean algorithm with subtraction:
     - While the two numbers are not equal:
       - Subtract the smaller number from the larger.
       - Assign the result to the larger number.
   - Once both numbers are equal, that value is the GCD.
   
   **Key points:**
   - This version uses subtraction repeatedly instead of the more common modulo operation; this works but is less efficient.
   - The subtraction approach repeatedly reduces the problem size until convergence.
   - **Time Complexity:** In the worst case, this subtraction method could take O(max(a, b)) iterations, which is less efficient than the modulo-based Euclidean algorithm with O(log(min(a,b))) complexity.

5. **Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GCDCalculator {

    // Method to compute GCD using subtraction-based Euclidean algorithm
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // If either number is zero, return the other number
        if (a == 0) return b;
        if (b == 0) return a;

        // Use subtraction until both numbers are equal
        while (a != b) {
            if (a > b) {
                a = a - b; // Subtract smaller number from larger
            } else {
                b = b - a;
            }
        }
        return a; // or b, since both are equal here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the values of a and b:");
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        int result = gcd(a, b);

        System.out.println("The GCD of " + a + " & " + b + " is: " + result);
        
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program reads inputs from the user, computes the GCD using the subtraction method, and prints the result, mirroring the functionality of the given C++ code.
