1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code implements the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to efficiently determine whether a given number is prime or not.


2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a sequence of integers (each between 0 and 1,000,000), determine for each input whether the number is a prime number or not. The input ends when the user enters -1.

**Context:**  
Prime number checking is a fundamental problem in computer science and mathematics. Efficient primality tests are critical in fields such as cryptography, number theory, and competitive programming. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic, efficient algorithm to preprocess and find all primes up to a large number in O(n log log n) time.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
7  
10  
-1  

Output:  
It is a Prime Number  
It is not a Prime Number  

**Explanation:** 7 is prime, 10 is not prime.

---

**Example 2 (Edge Case):**  
Input:  
0  
1  
2  
-1  

Output:  
It is not a Prime Number  
It is not a Prime Number  
It is a Prime Number  

**Explanation:** 0 and 1 are not prime by definition; 2 is the smallest prime number.

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- **Sieve Initialization:**  
  Create a boolean array, `prime[]`, up to the maximum range (1,000,000 here). Set all entries from 2 onward to `true` assuming all are initially prime.

- **Sieve Process:**  
  For each number `i` starting from 2 to 1,000,000:  
  - If it is still marked prime, mark all multiples of `i` (starting from `2*i`) as not prime (`false`).  
  This efficiently eliminates all composite numbers by marking their multiples.

- **Special Case:**  
  Mark 0 and 1 as not prime.

- **Querying:**  
  After sieve computation, you can check primality in O(1) by just looking up `prime[n]`.

**Time Complexity:**  
- Preprocessing sieve: O(N log log N), where N = 1,000,000  
- Querying each number: O(1)

**Optimization Notes:**  
- The sieve marks multiples starting from `2*i`, but it is more optimal to start from `i*i` to reduce redundant marking. This is a typical sieve optimization, but the provided code does not use it.

- Space complexity is O(N) for the boolean array.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrimeChecker {
    private static final int MAX = 1_000_000;
    private static boolean[] prime = new boolean[MAX + 1];

    // Sieve of Eratosthenes to preprocess primes
    private static void sieve() {
        // Initialize all as true from 2 onwards
        for (int i = 2; i <= MAX; i++) {
            prime[i] = true;
        }

        // Mark non-primes using sieve method
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; i++) {
            if (prime[i]) {
                // Mark multiples of i as not prime
                for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i) {
                    prime[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }

        // 0 and 1 are not prime
        prime[0] = false;
        prime[1] = false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        sieve();

        while (true) {
            int n = scanner.nextInt();
            if (n == -1) {
                break; // Exit condition
            }

            if (n >= 0 && n <= MAX) {
                if (prime[n]) {
                    System.out.println("It is a Prime Number");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("It is not a Prime Number");
                }
            } else {
                // Out of range input handling
                System.out.println("Input out of range (0 to " + MAX + ")");
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Key Java practices used:**

- The sieve is computed once before processing inputs.  
- Used descriptive method and variable names (`sieve`, `prime`).  
- Scanner is used for input.  
- Includes input validation for range.  
- Starts marking multiples from `i*i` for optimization.  
- Uses a constant for max array size.  
- Comments added for clarity.
