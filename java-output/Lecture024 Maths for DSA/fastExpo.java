1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code implements the **Fast Exponentiation** (also known as **Binary Exponentiation** or **Exponentiation by Squaring**) algorithm, which efficiently computes \(a^b\) (a raised to the power b) in \(O(\log b)\) time.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**

Given two integers \( a \) (the base) and \( b \) (the exponent), compute the value of \( a^b \) efficiently.

**Context:**

Computing powers directly using repeated multiplication can be slow for large exponents, taking \(O(b)\) time. Fast exponentiation optimizes this by reducing the number of multiplications to \(O(\log b)\), which is crucial in algorithms involving large powers such as modular exponentiation in cryptography, combinatorics, and competitive programming problems.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**

Input:  
a = 2, b = 5  
Output:  
\( 2^5 = 32 \)

**Example 2 (Edge case):**

Input:  
a = 3, b = 0  
Output:  
\( 3^0 = 1 \) (Any number to the power 0 is 1)

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- Initialize result \(res = 1\).
- While exponent \(b > 0\):
  - If \(b\) is odd (checked by \(b & 1\)), multiply current result by base \(a\).
  - Right-shift \(b\) by 1 bit (divide \(b\) by 2).
  - Square the base \(a = a \times a\).
- This effectively breaks down the exponent \( b \) in binary and accumulates the powers of \( a \) only where there is a '1' bit.
- The algorithm reduces time complexity from \(O(b)\) to \(O(\log b)\).

**Gotchas / Optimizations:**

- Handles large \(b\) efficiently.
- Works for non-negative integer exponents.
- If negative exponents are needed, additional handling is required (not covered in this code).

**Time Complexity:** \( O(\log b) \)

5. **Java Code:**

public class FastExponentiation {

    // Method to compute a^b using fast exponentiation
    public static int fastExpo(int a, int b) {
        int result = 1;

        while (b > 0) {
            // If b is odd, multiply result by a
            if ((b & 1) == 1) {
                result *= a;
            }
            b = b >> 1;   // Divide b by 2
            a = a * a;    // Square the base
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the values of a and b:");

        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        int answer = fastExpo(a, b);

        System.out.println("Answer is: " + answer);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
