1. **What the code solves:**
   
   The code computes the value of 2 raised to the power of a given integer n, i.e., it calculates \(2^n\).

2. **Problem description:**

   Write a function that calculates the power of 2 raised to a non-negative integer exponent \( n \). Formally, given an integer \( n \geq 0 \), compute \( 2^n \).

   This problem is a fundamental example of recursion used to understand recursive function calls and base cases. It is relevant in many areas of computer science such as binary computation, bit manipulation, and combinatorics. For instance, powers of two often represent sizes of data structures or number of possible subsets.

3. **Examples:**

   Example 1:  
   Input: 3  
   Output: 8  
   Explanation: \(2^3 = 8\).

   Example 2:  
   Input: 0  
   Output: 1  
   Explanation: By definition, any number raised to the power 0 is 1.

4. **Logic explanation:**

   - If \( n = 0 \), return 1 (base case).
   - Otherwise, recursively calculate \( 2^{n-1} \) and multiply the result by 2.
   - This builds the solution incrementally from the smallest problem (zero exponent) upwards.
   - This approach uses *simple recursion*.
   - **Time complexity:** \(O(n)\) because there are \(n\) recursive calls.

   **Optimization note:**  
   - For large \( n \), this method is inefficient due to linear depth recursion and repeated multiplications.
   - A better approach uses *exponentiation by squaring*, reducing complexity to \(O(\log n)\).

5. **Java code translation:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PowerOfTwo {

    // Recursive method to compute 2^n
    public static int power(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1; // base case
        }
        return 2 * power(n - 1); // recursive step
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a non-negative integer n: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        if (n < 0) {
            System.out.println("Input must be a non-negative integer.");
            scanner.close();
            return;
        }
        int result = power(n);
        System.out.println("2^" + n + " = " + result);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

- This Java program reads an integer from the user, validates it, computes \(2^n\) using recursion, and prints the result.
- Comments clarify the recursive logic and base case.
- `Scanner` is used for standard input.
