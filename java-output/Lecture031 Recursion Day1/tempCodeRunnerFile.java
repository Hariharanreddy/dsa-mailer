The provided C++ code snippet is just one line:
```cpp
if(n==0)
    return 1;
```
While minimal, this snippet usually appears as the base case in a classic recursive solution to the **factorial calculation** problem.

---

### 1. What the Code Solves

This code snippet is part of a **factorial function**, which computes \( n! \) (the factorial of n). Factorial is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and many algorithms.

---

### 2. Problem Description

**Factorial Computation Problem**

Write a function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \). The factorial of \( n \) (written as \( n! \)) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \):

- \( 0! = 1 \) by definition (base case).
- For \( n > 0 \), \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \).

*Use cases*: factorial functions are widely used in permutations, combinations, probability, and recursive algorithm demonstrations. It's a foundational exercise in many competitive programming problems and interview questions for recursion and iterative logic.

### 3. Examples

| Input \( n \) | Output \( n! \)          | Explanation                      |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0             | 1                       | By definition, factorial of 0 is 1 |
| 5             | 120                     | \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\) |

---

### 4. Explanation of the Logic

- **Base Case:** When \( n = 0 \), return 1 immediately (this prevents infinite recursion).
- **Recursive Case:** For \( n > 0 \), recursively compute factorial as \( n \times \text{factorial}(n-1) \).
- This uses **recursion**, a technique where the function calls itself with a smaller input.
- The small snippet `if(n==0) return 1;` ensures termination of recursion.

**Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) — The recursive calls go from n down to 0, performing a constant amount of work per call.

**Optimization Notes:**

- For large \( n \), iterative solutions or memoization may be preferable to avoid stack overflow.
- Calculating factorial for very large numbers requires handling large integer types or arbitrary precision arithmetic.

### 5. Java Code: Factorial Implementation

```java
public class FactorialCalculator {

    /**
     * Recursive method to compute factorial of a non-negative integer n.
     * @param n non-negative integer
     * @return factorial of n
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if n is negative
     */
    public static long factorial(int n) {
        if (n < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input must be non-negative.");
        }
        // Base case: 0! = 1
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] testValues = {0, 5, 10};

        for (int n : testValues) {
            System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " is " + factorial(n));
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The method `factorial` checks for invalid input.
- The base case uses the exact logic from the snippet (`if(n==0) return 1;`).
- Recursive calls continue until the base case.
- `main` tests the function with sample inputs.
- Uses `long` type — sufficient for factorials up to about 20! but beyond that, `BigInteger` is needed.
