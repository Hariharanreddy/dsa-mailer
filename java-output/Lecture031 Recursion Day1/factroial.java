1. **What the code solves:**  
The code calculates the **factorial of a non-negative integer** using a recursive approach. This is a classic problem in combinatorics and mathematics, frequently used as a basis to understand recursion in algorithms.

2. **Problem Description:**  
*Given a non-negative integer \( n \), compute the factorial of \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). By definition, \( 0! = 1 \). The task is to implement a function that, given \( n \), returns \( n! \).*

This problem is fundamental in programming education, recursion practice, and appears in many algorithmic challenges and mathematical computations such as permutations and combinations.

3. **Examples:**

| Input | Output | Explanation                      |
|-------|--------|--------------------------------|
| 5     | 120    | \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\) |
| 0     | 1      | By definition, \(0! = 1\)       |

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- **Step 1: Base Case**  
  If \( n = 0 \), return 1 directly (factorial of zero is one).

- **Step 2: Recursive Case**  
  Otherwise, recursively call the factorial function with \( n-1 \).

- **Step 3: Combine Results**  
  Multiply \( n \) by the factorial of \( n-1 \) to obtain the factorial of \( n \).

**Pattern/Technique:** Recursion — the problem is broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.

**Optimization/Gotchas:**  
- For very large \( n \), the factorial result can exceed the storage capacity of standard integer types (e.g., int in C++ or Java). Use larger data types or libraries supporting big integers if needed.  
- Recursive calls carry overhead and risk stack overflow for large input values. An iterative approach or tail recursion optimization (not supported in Java by default) could be considered.

**Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) — since the function calls itself \( n \) times, from \( n \) down to 0.

5. **Java Conversion:**  
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FactorialCalculator {

    // Recursive method to compute factorial of n
    private static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1; // base case
        }
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // recursive case
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a non-negative integer: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        if (n < 0) {
            System.out.println("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.");
        } else {
            int result = factorial(n);
            System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " is " + result);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
- The factorial method is marked `private static` since it is a helper method for the class and called within `main`.  
- Input is read using `Scanner`.  
- Includes a check for negative input to prevent invalid calls.  
- The recursion logic maintains clarity and matches the original C++ logic closely.
