1. **What the Code Solves:**

The provided C++ code is **a demonstration of how to use double-ended queues (deques) and queues**, which are fundamental data structures in computer science. It shows basic queue and deque operations like pushing elements at the front and back, popping from front/back, checking front and back elements, and verifying emptiness.

2. **Problem Description:**

Write a program to demonstrate and understand how double-ended queues (deques) and simple queues work. The program should:

- Insert elements at both ends of the deque.
- Access and remove elements from both ends.
- Check if the deque is empty after removals.
- (Optionally) Demonstrate basic queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, front access, and size queries.

This kind of problem is typical in data structure learning and interview preparation as deques and queues are essential in many algorithms (e.g., sliding window problems, breadth-first searches). Understanding how to manipulate these collections efficiently is a key skill.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Deque operations):

Input:  
Add 12 to front, add 14 to back  
Output:  
Front: 12  
Back: 14  
After popping front: Front is 14, Back is 14  
After popping back: Queue is empty

Example 2 (Queue operations - from commented code snippet):

Input:
Enqueue 11, 15, 13  
Output:  
Front after each insertion: 11  
Size before popping all: 3  
Size after popping all: 0  
Queue is empty

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- A **deque** is a double-ended queue supporting insertion/removal at both the front and back in O(1) time.
- We first push elements at both ends, use `front()` and `back()` to query ends.
- Then we pop elements from front and back to see how the deque shrinks and becomes empty.
- The code also includes commented out demonstration of the **queue**, which supports FIFO operations (push at back, pop from front).
- Key techniques: Use of STL deque and queue classes which handle internal data efficiently.
- Time complexity of each push/pop and access operation is **O(1)**.
- Important gotcha: Accessing front or back on empty deque/queue leads to undefined behavior; thus, check `empty()` before access/removal if used in practice.

public class QueueDequeDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Demonstrating Deque operations
        java.util.Deque<Integer> deque = new java.util.ArrayDeque<>();

        deque.offerFirst(12); // push_front equivalent
        deque.offerLast(14);  // push_back equivalent

        System.out.println(deque.peekFirst()); // front element
        System.out.println(deque.peekLast());  // back element

        deque.pollFirst(); // pop_front

        System.out.println(deque.peekFirst()); // new front
        System.out.println(deque.peekLast());  // back remains same

        deque.pollLast(); // pop_back

        if (deque.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("queue is empty");
        } else {
            System.out.println("queue is not empty");
        }

        // Demonstrating Queue operations
        java.util.Queue<Integer> queue = new java.util.LinkedList<>();

        queue.offer(11);
        System.out.println("front of q is: " + queue.peek()); // front

        queue.offer(15);
        System.out.println("front of q is: " + queue.peek());

        queue.offer(13);
        System.out.println("front of q is: " + queue.peek());

        System.out.println("size of queue is : " + queue.size());

        queue.poll();
        queue.poll();
        queue.poll();

        System.out.println("size of queue is : " + queue.size());

        if (queue.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Queue is empty");
        } else {
            System.out.println("queue is not empty");
        }
