1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code determines whether a given integer `n` is a **power of two**.

2. **Problem Statement:**

*Given an integer `n`, determine if it can be represented as \(2^k\) for some non-negative integer \(k\). Return `true` if it is a power of two, and `false` otherwise.*

**Context:**  
Checking if a number is a power of two is a classic problem in data structures and algorithms, frequently appearing in technical interviews and competitive programming. It relates to bit manipulation, number theory, and optimizing conditional checks. Powers of two have exactly one bit set in binary representation, which enables clever algorithmic shortcuts.

3. **Examples:**

| Input | Output | Explanation                     |
|-------|--------|---------------------------------|
| 16    | true   | \(16 = 2^4\) is a power of two  |
| 18    | false  | 18 is not a power of two        |

Edge Cases:

| Input | Output | Explanation                       |
|-------|--------|---------------------------------|
| 1     | true   | \(1 = 2^0\), considered power of two  |
| 0     | false  | 0 is not a power of two          |

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Initialize a variable `ans = 1` representing \(2^0\).
- Loop from `i = 0` to 30 (because \(2^{31}\) would exceed `int` range in C++).
- In each iteration:
  - Compare `ans` with `n`; if equal, return `true`.
  - Otherwise, multiply `ans` by 2 to get the next power of two.
  - Ensure multiplication doesnâ€™t overflow by checking `ans < INT_MAX/2`.
- If `n` was not found in these powers of two, return `false`.

**Optimizations/Gotchas:**

- This approach is straightforward but not the most efficient method available.
- A more optimal solution uses bit manipulation: `(n > 0) && ((n & (n - 1)) == 0)`.
- The current loop method avoids bitwise operations for clarity or instructional purposes.

**Time Complexity:**  
\(O(1)\) because the loop runs a fixed number of times (31 iterations max), independent of input size.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Checks if a number is a power of two.
     * @param n The integer to check.
     * @return true if n is a power of two, false otherwise.
     */
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // Initialize ans as 1 (2^0)
        int ans = 1;

        // Loop through powers of two up to 2^30
        for (int i = 0; i <= 30; i++) {
            if (ans == n) {
                return true; // Found n as a power of two
            }
            // Prevent integer overflow before doubling
            if (ans < Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2) {
                ans = ans * 2;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return false; // n is not a power of two
    }

    // Optional: main method for quick demonstration
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.isPowerOfTwo(16)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.isPowerOfTwo(18)); // false
    }
}
