1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code snippet solves the **"Allocate Minimum Number of Pages"** problem, which is a classic **binary search on the answer** problem commonly found in algorithm and interview question sets.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given `n` books with `arr[i]` pages in each book and `m` students, the task is to allocate books to students so that:

- Each student gets at least one book.
- The allocation is contiguous (each book should be assigned to exactly one student without skipping).
- The maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimized.

You want to minimize the maximum number of pages assigned to a student.

This problem is important in algorithms for demonstrating **binary search on the answer** techniques, as well as greedy subroutine checks. It has real-world analogue in workload balancing, resource allocation, and batch processing where tasks (pages) must be divided optimally between workers (students).

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**

Input:  
`arr = [12, 34, 67, 90]` (pages in each book)  
`n = 4` (number of books)  
`m = 2` (number of students)

Output:  
`113`

Explanation:  
Allocate books as [12, 34, 67] to student 1 and  to student 2.  
Maximum pages = max(12+34+67, 90) = 113 which is minimized.

---

**Example 2:**

Input:  
`arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]`  
`n = 4`  
`m = 2`

Output:  
`60`

Explanation:  
Allocate books as [10, 20, 30] to student 1 and  to student 2.  
Maximum pages = max(10+20+30, 40) = 60.

4. **Solution Logic:**

- **Key intuition:** The minimum maximum pages must lie between `max(arr)` and `sum(arr)`.  
- Use **binary search** on this range to guess a maximum number of pages `mid`.
- For each guess `mid`, use a helper function (`isPossible`) to check if it is possible to allocate books such that no student gets more than `mid` pages.
- To check feasibility (`isPossible`): iterate over books and assign them to the current student until adding a book exceeds `mid`; then assign books to the next student.
- If we need more than `m` students, `mid` is too small, so increase `mid`.
- Otherwise, try to reduce `mid` to find a smaller maximum allocation.
- Continue binary search until the smallest valid `mid` is found.

**Time complexity:**  
- The `isPossible` check is O(n) since it examines all books once.  
- Binary search range (`s` to `e`) initially is from max page count to sum of pages, so O(log(sum(arr))) iterations.  
- Overall time complexity: O(n * log(sum(arr))).

5. **Java Code Implementation:**

public class AllocateBooks {

    // Checks if it is possible to allocate books such that
    // maximum pages assigned does not exceed 'mid'
    private static boolean isPossible(int[] arr, int m, int mid) {
        int studentCount = 1;
        int pageSum = 0;

        for (int pages : arr) {
            // If single book pages exceed mid, allocation impossible
            if (pages > mid) {
                return false;
            }
            if (pageSum + pages <= mid) {
                pageSum += pages; // Assign book to current student
            } else {
                // Allocate new student
                studentCount++;
                if (studentCount > m) {
                    return false; // Need more students than allowed
                }
                pageSum = pages; // Start summation for new student
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Main function to allocate books to m students
    // such that max pages assigned is minimized
    public static int allocateBooks(int[] arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int sum = 0;
        int maxPages = 0;

        for (int pages : arr) {
            sum += pages;
            if (pages > maxPages) {
                maxPages = pages;
            }
        }

        int start = maxPages; // minimum possible max pages
        int end = sum;        // maximum possible max pages
        int result = -1;

        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (isPossible(arr, m, mid)) {
                result = mid;       // mid valid, try smaller
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;   // mid too small, increase
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    // Example driver code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] pages1 = {12, 34, 67, 90};
        System.out.println("Minimum maximum pages: " + allocateBooks(pages1, 2)); // Output: 113

        int[] pages2 = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        System.out.println("Minimum maximum pages: " + allocateBooks(pages2, 2)); // Output: 60
    }
