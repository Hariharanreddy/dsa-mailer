1. **What the Code Solves:**

This C++ code solves the classic **Bubble Sort** problem, which is a fundamental sorting algorithm in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the array is completely sorted.

**Context:**  
Bubble Sort is often introduced in computer science education for its simplicity and ease of understanding. It is frequently used to teach basic sorting concepts and algorithmic thinking. Although not efficient for large datasets due to its average and worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), it remains a foundational algorithm in learning sequences and recursion.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical Case):  
Input: [2, 5, 1, 6, 9]  
Output: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9]

Example 2 (Edge Case - Already Sorted):  
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Example 3 (Edge Case - Reverse Sorted):  
Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- **Base Case:** If the array size `n` is 0 or 1, itâ€™s already sorted, so return immediately.
- **One Pass:** Iterate through the array from 0 to `n-2`, and swap adjacent elements if the left one is greater than the right one. This ensures the largest element among the first `n` elements "bubbles" to the correct position at the end.
- **Recursion:** Recursively call the same function for the array size reduced by 1 (`n-1`). This excludes the last element (already sorted) from further steps.
- **Optimization:** This implementation uses recursion instead of iterative loops to demonstrate recursive problem-solving. The algorithm complexity remains \(O(n^2)\).
- **Time Complexity:** \(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\) in all cases since it performs comparisons and swaps in nested loops (recursive calls emulate looping).

5. **Java Conversion:**

public class BubbleSortRecursive {

    // Recursive bubble sort function
    private static void sortArray(int[] arr, int n) {
        // Base case: array of size 0 or 1 is already sorted
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return;
        }

        // Perform one pass to push the largest element to the end
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                // Swap adjacent elements if out of order
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
                arr[i + 1] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Recursive call for the remaining unsorted part
        sortArray(arr, n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 5, 1, 6, 9};

        sortArray(arr, arr.length);

        // Print the sorted array
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
