1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code implements **fast exponentiation (also called binary exponentiation or exponentiation by squaring)** to compute \(a^b\), i.e., raising a number \(a\) to the power \(b\) efficiently.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Name:** Fast Exponentiation / Power Calculation

**Problem Statement:**

Given two integers \(a\) and \(b\), compute \(a^b\) (a raised to the power b) efficiently without using built-in power functions. The exponent \(b\) is a non-negative integer.

**Context:**

Computing large powers naively by multiplying \(a\) with itself \(b\) times is slow (\(O(b)\) complexity). Fast exponentiation reduces this to \(O(\log b)\) by recursively squaring partial results. This problem is fundamental in many algorithmic areas such as modular arithmetic, cryptography, combinatorics, and competitive programming, where efficient power calculations are essential.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 — typical input:

Input:

```
a = 2
b = 10
```

Output:

```
Answer is 1024
```

Explanation: \(2^{10} = 1024\).

Example 2 — edge case (power zero):

Input:

```
a = 5
b = 0
```

Output:

```
Answer is 1
```

Explanation: Any number raised to the power zero equals 1.

4. **Logic Explained:**

- If \(b = 0\), return 1 because \(a^0 = 1\).
- If \(b = 1\), return \(a\), the base case for recursion.
- Recursively compute \(power(a, b/2)\) (integer division).
- If \(b\) is even, the result is \(power(a, b/2)^2\).
- If \(b\) is odd, multiply by \(a\) once more: \(a \times power(a, b/2)^2\).
- This reduces the number of multiplications significantly, exploiting the mathematical property \(a^b = (a^{b/2})^2\) when \(b\) is even, and \(a^b = a \times (a^{(b-1)/2})^2\) when \(b\) is odd.
- Time complexity is \(O(\log b)\), making it efficient for large powers.

5. **Java Equivalent Code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FastExponentiation {

    // Method to compute a^b using fast exponentiation (recursion)
    public static int power(int a, int b) {
        // Base case: a^0 = 1
        if (b == 0) {
            return 1;
        }

        // Base case: a^1 = a
        if (b == 1) {
            return a;
        }

        // Recursive call: compute power(a, b/2)
        int ans = power(a, b / 2);

        // If b is even, result is ans * ans
        if (b % 2 == 0) {
            return ans * ans;
        } else {
            // If b is odd, multiply by a once more
            return a * ans * ans;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Taking inputs a and b
        System.out.print("Enter base (a): ");
        int a = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter exponent (b): ");
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        int result = power(a, b);

        System.out.println("Answer is " + result);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
