1. **What the Code Solves:**

This C++ code prints a square pattern of asterisks (*) of size *n x n*, where *n* is an input integer.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer *n*, print a square pattern consisting of *n* rows and *n* columns, where each cell contains an asterisk (*). Each row should be printed on a new line.

**Context:**

This is a fundamental **pattern printing** problem frequently used in beginner-level programming courses and interview preparations. It tests understanding of nested loops and the ability to generate structured output, which are essential skills in algorithmic thinking and programming language syntax mastery. In real-world scenarios, such pattern problems are often used as practice exercises to strengthen control flow understanding.

3. **Examples:**

- Example 1:

Input:
```
3
```

Output:
```
***
***
***
```

Explanation: A 3x3 grid of asterisks is printed.

- Example 2 (Edge case with minimum size):

Input:
```
1
```

Output:
```
*
```

Explanation: A single asterisk is printed as the square is 1x1.

4. **Solution Logic:**

- Read the integer input *n* which defines the size of the square.

- Use an outer loop that runs from 1 to *n* — each iteration corresponds to a row.

- Inside the outer loop, use an inner loop that runs from 1 to *n* — each iteration prints an asterisk, forming one row.

- After printing *n* asterisks in a row, print a newline to move to the next row.

- The pattern uses **nested loops** to handle rows and columns.

- **Time complexity:** O(n²), as there are *n* rows and *n* columns, and each cell is printed once.

- Optimization isn't necessary for such a simple pattern; focus is on correct looping.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

public class SquarePatternPrinter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        
        int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Read the size of the square
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // For each row
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                System.out.print("*"); // Print asterisk without newline
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after printing one row
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
