1. **What the Code Solves:**  
This code prints all the integers from 1 up to `n` sequentially. It is a simple example demonstrating *iteration* (looping) in programming. The core concept is printing a sequence of natural numbers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Problem Description:**  
Write a program that takes a single integer input `n` and prints all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces. This problem tests your understanding of loops and basic input/output operations. Such a task is a foundational stepping stone in programming and algorithm practice, frequently encountered in beginner coding exercises and interviews.

3. **Examples:**

| Input | Output          | Explanation                                  |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 5     | 1 2 3 4 5       | Prints numbers from 1 to 5                     |
| 1     | 1               | Edge case, smallest positive number           |
| 10    | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 | Typical larger input printing 1 through 10  |

4. **Logic Explanation:**  
- Read the integer `n` from user input.  
- Initialize a counter `i` to 1.  
- Use a `while` loop that runs while `i` is less than or equal to `n`.  
- In each iteration, print the current value of `i` followed by a space.  
- Increment `i` by 1 after printing.  
- Loop ends once `i` exceeds `n`.  
- This approach uses simple iteration (looping), no recursion or complex data structures.  
- Time complexity is **O(n)** because it runs the loop exactly `n` times.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**  
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrintNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Read input
        
        int i = 1;
        
        while (i <= n) {
            System.out.print(i + " "); // Print current number with space
            i++; // Increment
        }
        
        scanner.close(); // Close resource
    }
}
```
