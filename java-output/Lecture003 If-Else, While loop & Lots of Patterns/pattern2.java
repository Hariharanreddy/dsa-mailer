1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code prints a pattern of numbers in a square matrix layout. The core concept demonstrated is **nested loops for pattern printing**.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given an integer \( n \), print a \( n \times n \) matrix where each row contains the same number equal to the row number (from 1 to \( n \)). The result is a square grid with each row filled with identical integers increasing from 1 in the first row to \( n \) in the last row.

This problem is a fundamental exercise to understand nested loops, which is essential for many programming tasks and is often used in teaching basic algorithmic problem-solving or during early stages of competitive programming.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**

Input:  
5

Output:
```
11111
22222
33333
44444
55555
```

**Example 2 (edge case):**

Input:  
1

Output:
```
1
```

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Take an input integer \( n \).
- Use an outer loop \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), representing each row.
- Inside the outer loop, use an inner loop \( j \) from 1 to \( n \) to print the current row number \( i \) \( n \) times.
- After finishing the inner loop for one row, print a newline to move to the next row.
  
**Key points:**  
- This is a simple *nested loop* pattern printing problem.
- No complex data structures are required.
- Time complexity is \( O(n^2) \) because of two nested loops each running \( n \) times.
  
No further optimizations are necessary since the problem size is linear and straightforward.

5. **Java Code:**

public class NumberPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);

        int n = scanner.nextInt();  // Read the size of the pattern

        // Outer loop for rows
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Inner loop for columns
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                System.out.print(i);  // Print the current row number
            }
            System.out.println();  // Move to the next line after printing each row
        }

        scanner.close();  // Close the scanner resource
    }
}
