1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code addresses the problem of **reversing a string in-place**, which is a fundamental operation in data structures and algorithms, particularly involving arrays and strings.


2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array of characters, reverse the array in-place *without* using additional memory for another array or string.

**Context:**

Reversing a string or array is a classic problem that tests understanding of array manipulation, two-pointer techniques, and in-place algorithms. This problem commonly appears in coding interviews and competitive programming as a subroutine for more complex string manipulations. In real-world contexts, reversing strings is used in text processing, palindromes detection, and data transformation tasks.


3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = ['h','e','l','l','o']
Output: ['o','l','l','e','h']
```

**Example 2 (Edge Case):**
```
Input: s = ['a']
Output: ['a']

Explanation: A single character reversed is the same character.
```

**Example 3 (Empty array):**
```
Input: s = []
Output: []
```


4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Initialize two pointers: one at the start (`st = 0`), and one at the end (`e = s.size() - 1`) of the character array.
- While `st < e`:
  - Swap the characters at indices `st` and `e`.
  - Increment `st` and decrement `e` to move towards the center.
- When `st` is greater than or equal to `e`, the reversal is complete.

**Techniques:**
- Uses the **two-pointer technique** for in-place array modification.
- No extra space is used aside from temporary variable in swapping, so it has **O(1) space complexity**.
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array, because each character is visited at most once.


5. **Java Implementation:**

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Reverses the characters of the input array in place.
     * @param s character array to reverse
     */
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = s.length - 1;

        // Swap characters moving inward from both ends
        while (start < end) {
            char temp = s[start];
            s[start] = s[end];
            s[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }

    // Optional main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        char[] example1 = {'h','e','l','l','o'};
        solution.reverseString(example1);
        System.out.println(example1); // prints: olleh

        char[] example2 = {'a'};
        solution.reverseString(example2);
        System.out.println(example2); // prints: a

        char[] example3 = {};
        solution.reverseString(example3);
        System.out.println(example3); // prints nothing (empty)
    }
}
