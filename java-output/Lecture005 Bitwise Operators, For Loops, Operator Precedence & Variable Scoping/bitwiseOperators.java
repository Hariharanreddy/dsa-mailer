1. **What the Code Solves:**

This snippet demonstrates **basic bitwise and unary operations and increment/decrement operators** in C++. It is not solving a classical DSA problem but is illustrating fundamental **bit manipulation techniques and operator behaviors** often used in data structures, low-level algorithms, or competitive programming.

---

2. **Problem Description:**

*Given two integers, demonstrate the result of various bitwise operations (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`), as well as bit shifts (left and right). Also, explore the behavior of pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement, and post-decrement operators on an integer.*

This helps students and interview candidates understand how bitwise operators manipulate bits directly and how increment/decrement operators differ in their operation and result. Bitwise manipulation is widely applicable in areas like cryptography, networking (IP masking), optimization problems, and system programming.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:
Input:
- a = 4 (binary 0100)
- b = 6 (binary 0110)

Output:
- a & b = 4 (0100 & 0110 = 0100)
- a | b = 6 (0100 | 0110 = 0110)
- ~a = -5 (bitwise NOT flips bits of 4)
- a ^ b = 2 (0100 ^ 0110 = 0010)

Bit shifts:
- 17 >> 1 = 8 (17 in binary 10001 shifted right by 1 is 1000)
- 17 >> 2 = 4
- 19 << 1 = 38
- 21 << 2 = 84

Increment/Decrement on i = 7:
- ++i = 8 (pre-increment)
- i++ = 8 (post-increment, returns old value, then i=9)
- i-- = 9 (post-decrement, returns old value, then i=8)
- --i = 7 (pre-decrement)

Example 2 (Edge Case):
- For a = 0, b = 1
  - a & b = 0
  - a | b = 1
  - ~a = -1 (bitwise negation flips all bits)
  - a ^ b = 1

Bit shifts on small numbers confirm that right shifting zero remains zero, and left shifts multiply by powers of two.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- **Bitwise AND (&):** Compares each bit of two numbers and returns 1 only if both bits are 1.
- **Bitwise OR (|):** Returns 1 if at least one of the bits is 1.
- **Bitwise NOT (~):** Flips all bits (including sign bit in two's complement).
- **Bitwise XOR (^):** Returns 1 only if bits differ.
- **Left shift (<<):** Shifts bits to the left; effectively multiplies by 2 for each shift.
- **Right shift (>>):** Shifts bits to the right; effectively divides by 2 for each shift, floors for integers.

- **Increment Operators:**
  - *Pre-increment (++i):* Increments i, then returns the incremented value.
  - *Post-increment (i++):* Returns current i, then increments.
  
- **Decrement Operators:**
  - *Pre-decrement (--i):* Decrements i, then returns the decremented value.
  - *Post-decrement (i--):* Returns current i, then decrements.

**Patterns/Techniques:** Understanding bitwise operations is crucial for performance-sensitive problems where low-level data manipulation or optimization is needed. Increment/decrement operator nuances can affect loop counters and algorithm correctness.

**Time Complexity:** All operations happen in O(1) constant time as they are direct CPU/instruction level operations.

5. **Java Equivalent Code:**

public class BitwiseOperationsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 4;
        int b = 6;

        // Bitwise AND
        System.out.println("a & b = " + (a & b)); // 4
        // Bitwise OR
        System.out.println("a | b = " + (a | b)); // 6
        // Bitwise NOT
        System.out.println("~a = " + (~a));       // -5 (due to two's complement)
        // Bitwise XOR
        System.out.println("a ^ b = " + (a ^ b)); // 2

        // Bit shifts
        System.out.println("17 >> 1 = " + (17 >> 1)); // 8
        System.out.println("17 >> 2 = " + (17 >> 2)); // 4
        System.out.println("19 << 1 = " + (19 << 1)); // 38
        System.out.println("21 << 2 = " + (21 << 2)); // 84

        int i = 7;

        // Pre-increment: increments then uses value
        System.out.println("++i = " + (++i)); // 8
        // Post-increment: uses value then increments
        System.out.println("i++ = " + (i++)); // 8 (then i=9)
        // Post-decrement: uses value then decrements
        System.out.println("i-- = " + (i--)); // 9 (then i=8)
        // Pre-decrement: decrements then uses value
        System.out.println("--i = " + (--i)); // 7
    }
}
