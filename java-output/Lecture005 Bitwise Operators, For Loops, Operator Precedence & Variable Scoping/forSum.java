1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code computes the sum of the first *n* natural numbers. It addresses the fundamental algorithmic concept of *simple iteration to perform a summation*.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Sum of First N Natural Numbers**  
Write a program that takes a positive integer *n* as input and outputs the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to *n* inclusive.  

This problem is foundational in computer science and algorithm studies, demonstrating basic loops and arithmetic progression. It often appears in beginner programming assignments and technical interviews to assess understanding of iteration and arithmetic calculations.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input:  
n = 5  
Output:  
15  
Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15  

Example 2 (Edge Case):  
Input:  
n = 1  
Output:  
1  
Explanation: The smallest natural number sum is just itself.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to hold the cumulative total.  
- Iterate from 1 through *n* using a loop.  
- In each iteration, add the current number to `sum`.  
- After completing the loop, output the value stored in `sum`.  

**Pattern/Technique:**  
This is a straightforward iterative technique using a `for` loop to aggregate values.

**Optimization:**  
Alternatively, the problem can be solved in O(1) time using the formula \( \frac{n \times (n+1)}{2} \), which calculates the sum of the first *n* natural numbers directly without iteration.

**Time Complexity:**  
The code currently runs in **O(n)** time due to the loop from 1 to *n*.

5. **Java Code:**

public class SumOfNaturalNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("Enter the value of n:");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        
        int sum = 0;
        
        // Loop from 1 to n and accumulate the sum
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        
        System.out.println("Sum of first " + n + " natural numbers is: " + sum);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
