1. **What the Code Solves:**  
The given C++ code solves the **Hamming Weight** or **Number of 1 Bits** problem from bit manipulation in Data Structures and Algorithms.

2. **Problem Description:**  
*Given an integer, determine the number of bits set to 1 in its binary representation.* This problem is commonly known as finding the "Hamming weight" or "popcount" of a number. It has practical applications in fields like cryptography, error detection/correction codes, and optimization problems where bit-level operations increase efficiency. In competitive programming, it is a basic bit manipulation task often used as a building block for more complex problems.

3. **Examples:**

| Input (Decimal) | Binary Representation | Output (Number of 1 bits) |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| 11              | 1011                  | 3                         |
| 128             | 10000000              | 1                         |

- Example 1: Input = 11 (binary 1011), the output is 3 because there are three 1s in the binary form.  
- Example 2: Input = 128 (binary 10000000), the output is 1 since there is only one set bit.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Initialize a count to 0 for counting set bits.
- While the number is not zero:
  - Check if the least significant bit (LSB) is 1 by performing a bitwise AND with 1.
  - If the LSB is 1, increment the count.
  - Right-shift the number by 1 bit to process the next bit.
- Return the count after all bits have been checked.

**Pattern/Technique:** Bit manipulation using shifting and bitwise AND.

**Optimization:**  
There are more optimized ways like Brian Kernighanâ€™s algorithm that repeatedly clears the least significant set bit, which can be faster for sparse bitsets; however, this code uses a straightforward bit checking loop.

**Time Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of bits in the integer representation (usually 32 or 64).

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

public class Solution {

    /**
     * Counts the number of 1 bits (Hamming Weight) in the binary representation of the input.
     * @param n the integer to count set bits in
     * @return the number of set bits
     */
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        // Iterate through all bits until n becomes zero
        while (n != 0) {
            // If the least significant bit is 1, increment count
            if ((n & 1) == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            // Unsigned right shift to process the next bit without sign extension
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

    // Example usage and testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        int input1 = 11;
        System.out.println("Number of 1 bits in " + input1 + " is: " + sol.hammingWeight(input1)); 
        // Expected output: 3

        int input2 = 128;
        System.out.println("Number of 1 bits in " + input2 + " is: " + sol.hammingWeight(input2)); 
        // Expected output: 1

        // Edge case: input = 0 (no bits set)
        int input3 = 0;
        System.out.println("Number of 1 bits in " + input3 + " is: " + sol.hammingWeight(input3)); 
        // Expected output: 0
    }
