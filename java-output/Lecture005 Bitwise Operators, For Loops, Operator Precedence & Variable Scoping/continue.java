1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code snippet does **not solve any standard Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem**. Instead, it demonstrates basic control flow concepts, specifically the use of the `continue` statement inside a loop.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given a loop that iterates a fixed number of times, the program prints two specific strings each iteration and uses the `continue` statement to skip the rest of the loop body after these prints.

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that executes a loop 5 times. In each iteration, print `"HI"` and `"Hey"` on separate lines, then immediately skip any further statements in that iteration.

**Context:**  
While not a typical algorithmic problem, understanding loop control statements such as `continue` is fundamental to mastering flow control in programming. This concept is crucial in writing efficient loops and is often tested in beginner programming interviews.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:** (Normal behavior)

Input: No input required (fixed loop count of 5)

Output:
```
HI
Hey
HI
Hey
HI
Hey
HI
Hey
HI
Hey
```

**Example 2:** (Edge case - no iterations)

If the loop count were zero (not in given code, but hypothetically):

Input: 0 iterations

Output: (no output)

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- A `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 5`, so it iterates 5 times.
- In each iteration:
  - Print `"HI"`
  - Print `"Hey"`
  - Execute `continue;` which immediately jumps to the next iteration, skipping any code after `continue`.
- Therefore, the line `cout << "Reply toh karde" << endl;` inside the loop is never executed.
- This example mainly illustrates the behavior of the `continue` statement inside loops.

**Time Complexity:**  
O(1) since the loop runs a fixed 5 times, which is constant time.

5. **Java Equivalent:**

public class LoopContinueDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

            System.out.println("HI");

            System.out.println("Hey");

            // continue skips to next iteration; code below is never reached

            continue;

            // This line is unreachable

            // System.out.println("Reply toh karde");

        }

    }

}

This Java program behaves identically to the given C++ code, printing “HI” and “Hey” five times and skipping the last print statement each iteration due to the continue.
