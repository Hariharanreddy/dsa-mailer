1. **What the Code Solves:**

The code implements a simple **array reversal** algorithm, a fundamental concept in data structures and algorithms.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Reverse an array**: Given an array of integers, reverse the order of its elements in place, i.e., modify the original array so that the first element becomes the last, the second becomes second last, and so on.

This problem is a classic example often used to practice working with arrays and pointers/indexing, and it serves as a building block for more complex algorithms. It is common in competitive programming, coding interviews, and scenarios where you need efficient data transformation without using extra space.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical Case):

Input: arr = [1, 4, 0, 5, -2, 15]

Output: [15, -2, 5, 0, 4, 1]

Explanation: The original array is reversed element-wise.

Example 2 (Edge Case - Odd number of elements):

Input: arr = [2, 6, 3, 9, 4]

Output: [4, 9, 3, 6, 2]

Explanation: The middle element (3 in this case) stays in the same position since it's the center of the reversal.

4. **Logic Explained:**

- Use two pointers/indices: one starting at the beginning (`start = 0`), and the other at the end (`end = n - 1`).

- Swap the elements at these two indices.

- Move `start` forward and `end` backward.

- Repeat swapping until `start` is greater than or equal to `end`.

- This effectively mirrors the array around its center.

**Techniques used:** Two-pointer approach, in-place swapping.

**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the array, because each element is touched at most once in swapping.

**Space complexity:** O(1), since reversal is done in place without extra space.

5. **Java Code Equivalent:**

public class ArrayReversal {

    // Method to reverse the array in place
    public static void reverse(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        while (start <= end) {
            // Swap elements at start and end indices
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;

            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }

    // Utility method to print the array elements
    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Main method to test the reversal
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {1, 4, 0, 5, -2, 15};
        int[] arr2 = {2, 6, 3, 9, 4};

        reverse(arr1);
        reverse(arr2);

        printArray(arr1); // Expected output: 15 -2 5 0 4 1
        printArray(arr2); // Expected output: 4 9 3 6 2
    }
}
