1. **What the Code Solves:**

This code solves the **Linear Search** problem, a fundamental search algorithm used in data structures and algorithms (DSA).

2. **Problem Description:**

Given an array (or list) of integers and a target key, determine whether the key exists in the array. The problem asks you to search through the array sequentially to find if any element matches the given key.

*Real-world relevance:* Linear search is a simple search method used when data is unsorted or when the dataset is small. It's often a baseline algorithm to introduce searching before more advanced methods like binary search.

*Competitive programming context:* It is a basic problem testing understanding of iteration, conditionals, and early return optimizations.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical case):  
Input: arr = [5, 7, -2, 10, 22], key = 10  
Output: Key is present  
Explanation: The key 10 occurs in the array.

Example 2 (Edge case - key not present):  
Input: arr = [5, 7, -2, 10, 22], key = 15  
Output: Key is absent  
Explanation: The key 15 does not occur anywhere in the array.

4. **Logic Explained:**

- Iterate through each element of the array one by one.
- For each element, compare it with the key.
- If a match is found, return `true` immediately (early exit).
- If the loop ends without finding the key, return `false`.
- This approach is straightforward linear scanning without any sorting or advanced data structures.

**Techniques used:**  
- Simple iteration (for loop)  
- Early termination on successful condition

**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because in the worst case, you might check every element once.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

public class LinearSearchExample {

    // Function to perform linear search in the array
    public static boolean search(int[] arr, int key) {
        for (int element : arr) {  // Iterate through array elements
            if (element == key) {
                return true;        // Key found, return true early
            }
        }
        return false;               // Key not found after full traversal
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 7, -2, 10, 22, -2, 0, 5, 22, 1};
        System.out.println("Enter the element to search for:");

        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        int key = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        boolean found = search(arr, key);

        if (found) {
            System.out.println("Key is present");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Key is absent");
        }
    }
}
