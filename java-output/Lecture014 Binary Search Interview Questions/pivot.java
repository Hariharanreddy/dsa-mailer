1. **What the Code Solves:**

The code identifies the **pivot (smallest element) index in a rotated sorted array** — a common subproblem in array and searching algorithms often associated with binary search.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given a sorted array that has been rotated at some unknown pivot, find the index of the smallest element (pivot). For example, an originally sorted array like [1, 3, 8, 10, 17] might be rotated to [10, 17, 1, 3, 8]. The task is to determine the index where the rotation happened, i.e., the index of the minimum element.

This problem is important in algorithmic contexts where rotated arrays appear — such as searching in rotated arrays, cyclic arrays, and optimization problems. It often appears in competitive programming and technical interviews, testing understanding of binary search adaptation.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:
Input: [10, 17, 1, 3, 8]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: The smallest element is 1 at index 2, indicating the pivot.

Example 2:
Input: [1, 3, 8, 10, 17] (no rotation)  
Output: 0  
Explanation: The smallest element is at index 0, since the array was not rotated.

4. **Logic Explanation (Point-wise):**

- We use a **modified binary search** to find the pivot index.
- Initialize two pointers `s` (start) at 0 and `e` (end) at `n-1`.
- Calculate `mid = s + (e - s)/2`.
- Check if the middle element is greater than or equal to the first element in the array:
  - If yes, it means the smallest element is to the right of `mid` (because the left part is sorted and higher or equal to the start), so move `s` to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, the smallest element is at `mid` or to the left, so move `e` to `mid`.
- Repeat until `s` meets `e`. `s` will point to the pivot.
- The logic exploits that in a rotated array the pivot is the only place where the order breaks—from a large element to a smaller element.
- **Time complexity**: O(log n) due to binary search.

5. **Java Code:**

public class FindPivot {
    // Returns the index of the pivot (smallest element) in rotated sorted array
    public static int getPivot(int[] arr) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = arr.length - 1;
        
        // If array is not rotated, the smallest element is at index 0
        if (arr[s] <= arr[e]) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        while (s < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
            
            // If mid element is greater or equal to first element,
            // the smallest must be in right half
            if (arr[mid] >= arr) {
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Otherwise smallest is in left half including mid
                e = mid;
            }
        }
        return s;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {10, 17, 1, 3, 8}; // rotated case
        System.out.println("Pivot is at index: " + getPivot(arr1)); // Output: 2
        
        int[] arr2 = {1, 3, 8, 10, 17}; // not rotated
        System.out.println("Pivot is at index: " + getPivot(arr2)); // Output: 0
    }
}
