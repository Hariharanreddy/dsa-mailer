1. **What the Code Solves:**  
This C++ code calculates the square root of an integer number **n** up to a certain decimal precision, implementing an algorithm to find the integer part of the square root using **binary search**, then refines the result to fractional parts by incrementally testing decimal values.

2. **Problem Description:**  
**Find the Square Root of a Number with Precision**

Given a non-negative integer **n**, compute the square root of **n** rounded down (floor value) to the desired number of decimal places. The problem involves finding the integer square root first, then incrementally improving that answer for fractional digits. This is a classic numerical approximation problem that frequently appears in algorithmic challenges and interview scenarios to test binary search application and precise floating-point arithmetic.

*Real-world relevance:* Calculating square roots accurately and efficiently is fundamental in fields like computer graphics, engineering simulations, and scientific computations where built-in square root functions may not be usable or desired for precision control.

3. **Examples:**

| Input | Precision | Output         | Explanation                                        |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 16    | 3         | 4.000          | sqrt(16) is exactly 4                             |
| 20    | 3         | 4.472          | sqrt(20) is approximately 4.4721; output truncated to 3 decimals |

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** Use binary search to find the *integer part* of the square root:
  - Initialize `start = 0` and `end = n`.
  - While `start <= end`:
    - Compute `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`.
    - If `mid * mid == n`, return `mid`.
    - If `mid * mid < n`, store `mid` as a temporary answer and set `start = mid + 1`.
    - Else, set `end = mid - 1`.
  - After loop ends, `ans` holds the floor value of sqrt(n).
  
- **Step 2:** Increase precision incrementally:
  - For each decimal place up to the required precision:
    - Divide the factor by 10 (for tenths, hundredths, etc.).
    - From the current approximation, increment by this factor until `(candidate * candidate)` exceeds `n`.
    - Last candidate before exceeding `n` is kept as the answer.

- **Optimization & Patterns:**  
  The binary search efficiently reduces the search space for the integer part, making the process O(log n). The decimal increment refining is a linear scan with decreasing step size, essentially a controlled brute force for decimal places, O(precision * 10) at worst.

- **Time complexity:**  
  - Integer part: O(log n) due to binary search  
  - Precision increment: O(precision * 10) (typically precision is small)  
  Overall efficient for typical inputs.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SquareRootApproximation {

    // Find integer square root using binary search
    private static long sqrtInteger(int n) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = n;
        long ans = -1;

        while (start <= end) {
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            long square = mid * mid;

            if (square == n) {
                return mid; // Exact square root found
            }

            if (square < n) {
                ans = mid;    // Update answer and search right half
                start = (int) mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = (int) mid - 1; // Search left half
            }
        }
        return ans; // Floor of the square root
    }

    // Increase precision by incremental checks
    private static double morePrecision(int n, int precision, long tempSol) {
        double factor = 1;
        double ans = tempSol;

        for (int i = 0; i < precision; i++) {
            factor /= 10;

            // Increment ans by factor until ans*ans exceeds n
            while ((ans + factor) * (ans + factor) <= n) {
                ans += factor;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the number:");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        // Get integer part of sqrt
        long tempSol = sqrtInteger(n);

        // Desired decimal precision (e.g., 3 for 3 decimal places)
        int precision = 3;

        double answer = morePrecision(n, precision, tempSol);

        System.out.printf("Answer is %.3f%n", answer);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Notes:**  
- Used `long` type for intermediate calculations to avoid integer overflow for `mid * mid`.  
- Used `Scanner` for input and `printf` to format output with specified decimals.  
- Code is encapsulated in a single public class with private static methods for clarity.  
- Comments explain key steps and decisions.
