1. **What the Code Solves:**

This C++ code solves the problem of **searching an element in a rotated sorted array** using an efficient binary search variant.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given a sorted array of integers that has been **rotated at some unknown pivot point**, your task is to find the index of a given target element. If the element is not present, return -1.

A rotated sorted array is created by taking a sorted array and rotating it, so the order is disrupted but the array remains partially sorted. For example, `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` is a sorted array `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` rotated at pivot index 4.

**Real-world relevance:**  
This problem is common in technical interviews and competitive programming because it requires understanding how to combine binary search with additional logic to handle the rotation â€” a classic example of modified binary search. It tests problem-solving, edge case handling, and algorithm optimization skills.

3. **Examples:**

- Example 1: Typical case  
Input: arr = [7, 9, 1, 2, 3], key = 2  
Output: 3  
Explanation: 2 is present at index 3 in this rotated array.

- Example 2: Element not present  
Input: arr = [15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12], key = 7  
Output: -1  
Explanation: 7 is not in the rotated array.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- **Find the pivot index:**  
  - Use a binary search to find the smallest element's index, which represents the pivot where rotation happened.  
  - This pivot splits the array into two sorted subarrays.

- **Determine which subarray to search:**  
  - If the key lies between `arr[pivot]` and `arr[end]`, search in the right subarray (`pivot` to `n - 1`).  
  - Otherwise, search in the left subarray (`0` to `pivot - 1`).

- **Binary search within the chosen subarray:**  
  - Perform a standard binary search to find the key's index.

- **Time complexity:**  
  - Finding pivot takes O(log n).  
  - Binary search also takes O(log n).  
  - Overall complexity: **O(log n)**.

- **Optimization/Gotchas:**  
  - Careful handling of indices to avoid infinite loops.  
  - Use `mid = start + (end - start) / 2` to avoid integer overflow.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

public class RotatedSortedArraySearch {

    // Method to find pivot index where array rotation happens (smallest element)
    private static int getPivot(int[] arr, int n) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = n - 1;
        
        // Binary search for pivot
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            // If mid element is greater or equal to first element, pivot is to the right
            if (arr[mid] >= arr) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Pivot is on left including mid
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start; // Pivot index
    }

    // Standard binary search between indices s and e
    private static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int s, int e, int key) {
        int start = s;
        int end = e;
        
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            if (arr[mid] == key) {
                return mid; // Found key
            }
            
            if (key > arr[mid]) {
                start = mid + 1; // Search right
            } else {
                end = mid - 1; // Search left
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    // Public method to find key position in rotated sorted array
    public static int findPosition(int[] arr, int key) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int pivot = getPivot(arr, n);
        
        // If key lies within right half
        if (key >= arr[pivot] && key <= arr[n - 1]) {
            return binarySearch(arr, pivot, n - 1, key);
        } else {
            // Otherwise search left half
            return binarySearch(arr, 0, pivot - 1, key);
        }
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {7, 9, 1, 2, 3};
        int key1 = 2;
        System.out.println(findPosition(arr1, key1));  // Output: 3
        
        int[] arr2 = {15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12};
        int key2 = 7;
        System.out.println(findPosition(arr2, key2));  // Output: -1
    }
