1. **What the Code Solves:**
This code solves the **"Maximal Rectangle in a Binary Matrix"** problem, a common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenge that finds the largest rectangular area composed entirely of 1s in a 2D binary matrix.

2. **Problem Description:**
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0s and 1s, the task is to find the largest rectangle containing only 1s and return its area. This problem is a fundamental extension of the "largest rectangle in a histogram" problem and is commonly asked in coding interviews and competitive programming to test understanding of stacks and dynamic programming concepts.

**Context:**  
In real-world applications like image processing and computer vision, such problems relate to identifying the largest uniform region. In competitive programming, efficient stack-based solutions are preferred due to their linear time complexity.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input:  
```
Matrix =
[
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]
```
Output:  
`6`  
Explanation: The largest rectangle of 1s has area 6 (3 rows Ã— 2 columns).

Example 2 (Edge case - all zeros):  
Input:  
```
Matrix =
[
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]
]
```
Output:  
`0`  
Explanation: No 1's present, so max rectangle area is 0.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- The problem reduces to repeatedly finding the largest rectangle histogram for each row when interpreted as heights.
- **Key insight:** For each row, treat all consecutive 1s in the columns as heights building on previous rows.
- Steps:
  1. Compute the largest rectangle in histogram for the first row.
  2. For each subsequent row, update each element in the matrix:
     - If the current cell is non-zero, add the value from the previous row's same column (stacking heights).
     - Else reset to zero.
  3. Compute the largest rectangle histogram on the updated row.
  4. Track the maximum area during all iterations.

- The largest rectangle in histogram is solved using:
  - Two helper functions to find the index of the previous smaller element and the next smaller element for each bar.
  - Compute width using these indexes.
  - Calculate area for each bar as height \* width.
  - Track the maximum area.

- **Optimizations/gotchas:**
  - Use stacks for previous and next smaller elements for O(n) scanning.
  - Handle the edge case where next smaller element doesn't exist (assigning it to array length).
  
- **Time Complexity:**  
The overall time complexity is O(n * m) where n is number of rows and m is number of columns. Each row involves an O(m) histogram area computation.

5. **Java Conversion:**

            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, largestRectangleArea(matrix[i]));
        }
        return maxArea;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = sc.nextInt();

**Explanation of Java code:**  
- Converted C++ vectors to Java arrays.  
- Replaced `stack<int>` with Java `Stack<Integer>`, using `peek()` instead of `top()`.  
- Used `Scanner` for input.  
- Followed naming conventions with camelCase.  
- Added comments on important logic areas (e.g., updating rows, finding next/prev smaller).  
- `maxArea` method implements the main logic to solve multiple test cases.  

This Java class is ready to compile and run and retains the same functionality and efficiency as the C++ original.
