1. **What the Code Solves:**  
This code solves the problem of **adding two large integers represented as arrays of digits** and returning the sum as another array of digits. The core DSA concept addressed is **simulating addition of large numbers using arrays**, commonly known as **"Add Two Numbers" or "Big Number Addition"**.

2. **Problem Description:**  
Given two arrays, each representing a non-negative integer where every element is a digit, write a function to add these two numbers and return the sum as a new array of digits. The arrays may differ in length, representing numbers of different digit counts. The addition must handle digit-wise carry correctly.

This type of problem is useful in situations where numbers are too large to fit into standard integer types, such as cryptography, competitive programming problems on big integer arithmetic, or in scenarios involving arbitrary precision arithmetic.

3. **Examples:**  
- Example 1:  
  Input: a = [1, 2, 3], b = [4, 5, 6]  
  Explanation: 123 + 456 = 579  
  Output: [5, 7, 9]

- Example 2 (different lengths and carry):  
  Input: a = [9, 9, 9], b = [1]  
  Explanation: 999 + 1 = 1000  
  Output: [1, 0, 0, 0]

4. **Logic Explanation:**  
- Start from the last digit of both arrays (least significant digit) and move towards the first (most significant digit).  
- Initialize a carry variable to 0.  
- Add corresponding digits from both arrays plus the carry.  
- Calculate new digit = (sum % 10) and update carry = (sum / 10).  
- Append the new digit to the result array (which is built in reverse order because addition starts from least significant digit).  
- If one array finishes before the other, continue adding remaining digits plus carry.  
- If carry remains after processing all digits, append it as a new digit.  
- Reverse the result array to get the final sum from most significant to least significant digit.

**Optimizations/Gotchas:**  
- Make sure to handle carry properly throughout the addition.  
- The input arrays may have different lengths.  
- The result array is constructed in reverse, so reversing at the end is necessary.  
- Time complexity: O(max(n, m)) where n and m are the lengths of the two input arrays, since we process every digit once.

5. **Java Code Implementation:**

public class BigNumberAddition {

    // Helper method to reverse the list of digits
    private static int[] reverse(int[] arr) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return arr;
    }

    // Method to add two numbers represented as arrays of digits
    public static int[] findArraySum(int[] a, int[] b) {
        int n = a.length;
        int m = b.length;

        int i = n - 1; // pointer for array a
        int j = m - 1; // pointer for array b

        // Using dynamic structure to hold result initially
        java.util.ArrayList<Integer> ans = new java.util.ArrayList<>();

        int carry = 0;

        // Add digits from right to left while both arrays have digits
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            int sum = a[i] + b[j] + carry;
            carry = sum / 10;
            ans.add(sum % 10);
            i--;
            j--;
        }

        // Process remaining digits of a, if any
        while (i >= 0) {
            int sum = a[i] + carry;
            carry = sum / 10;
            ans.add(sum % 10);
            i--;
        }

        // Process remaining digits of b, if any
        while (j >= 0) {
            int sum = b[j] + carry;
            carry = sum / 10;
            ans.add(sum % 10);
            j--;
        }

        // If carry remains, add it
        while (carry != 0) {
            ans.add(carry % 10);
            carry = carry / 10;
        }

        // Convert ArrayList to array and reverse it to get most significant digit first
        int[] result = new int[ans.size()];
        for (int k = 0; k < ans.size(); k++) {
            result[k] = ans.get(k);
        }
        reverse(result);

        return result;
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a1 = {1, 2, 3};
        int[] b1 = {4, 5, 6};
        int[] sum1 = findArraySum(a1, b1);
        System.out.print("Sum 1: ");
        for (int digit : sum1) {
            System.out.print(digit);
        }
        System.out.println();

        int[] a2 = {9, 9, 9};
        int[] b2 = {1};
        int[] sum2 = findArraySum(a2, b2);
        System.out.print("Sum 2: ");
        for (int digit : sum2) {
            System.out.print(digit);
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
