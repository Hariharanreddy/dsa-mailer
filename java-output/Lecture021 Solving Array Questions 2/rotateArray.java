1. **What the Code Solves:**

This code solves the **Array Rotation** problem, specifically rotating an array to the right by *k* steps.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given an integer array and a non-negative integer *k*, rotate the array *k* steps to the right. Rotating the array means that the elements at the end of the array wrap around to the front. This is a common problem to test understanding of arrays, modular arithmetic, and in-place data manipulation. It is a frequent question in coding interviews and competitive programming due to its simple statement but multiple solution approaches that demonstrate algorithmic thinking.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3  
Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]  
Explanation: Rotate the array 3 steps to the right.

Example 2: (Edge case: rotation by array length)
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 5  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Explanation: Rotating by the array length results in the same array.

4. **Explanation of Logic:**

- The idea is to create a temporary array of the same size.
- For each element at index `i` in the original array, calculate the new position using `(i + k) % n`, where `n` is the size of the array.
- Place the element in the temporary array at this new position.
- Finally, copy the temporary array back into the original array.
- This approach uses modular arithmetic to handle wrapping around the array indices.
- The code is straightforward and easy to understand, though it uses O(n) additional space.
- Alternative in-place solutions exist but are more complex, involving reversing subarrays.
- **Time complexity:** O(n) for traversing the array twice (once to copy and once to write back).  
- **Space complexity:** O(n) due to the temporary array.

5. **Java Translation:**

public class Solution {

    /**  
     * Rotates the given array nums to the right by k steps.  
     * @param nums the integer array to rotate  
     * @param k number of steps to rotate  
     */
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] temp = new int[n];
        
        // Place each element at its new rotated position
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            temp[(i + k) % n] = nums[i];
        }
        
        // Copy back the rotated elements to original array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            nums[i] = temp[i];
        }
    }

    // Optional: main method to test the rotate function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
        int k1 = 3;
        sol.rotate(arr1, k1);
        System.out.print("Output after rotating by 3: ");
        for (int num : arr1) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();

        int[] arr2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k2 = 5;
        sol.rotate(arr2, k2);
        System.out.print("Output after rotating by 5: ");
        for (int num : arr2) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
