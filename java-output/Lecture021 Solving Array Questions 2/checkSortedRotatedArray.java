1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code determines whether a given integer array is a **rotated non-decreasing (sorted) array**. This problem is commonly known as checking whether an array is a sorted array that has been "rotated" some number of times.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**  
*Given an array of integers, determine if it can be considered a rotated version of a non-decreasing sorted array.* In other words, the array originally was sorted in non-decreasing order but then some leading elements were moved to the end, forming a rotation. Your task is to verify this property.

**Context:**  
This problem is frequently encountered in coding interviews and competitive programming as it helps test understanding of array traversal, rotation logic, and order checking without extra space. It generalizes the concept of sorted arrays and relates to searching in a rotated sorted array or handling circular arrays.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]  
Output: true  
Explanation: The array is originally sorted as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], rotated starting from 3.

Example 2:  
Input: [2, 1, 3, 4]  
Output: false  
Explanation: This array cannot be obtained by rotating a non-decreasing sorted array.

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- Initialize a count to track how many times the array "drops" from a larger to a smaller value as you traverse.
- Traverse the array from the second element to the end:
  - If the current element is smaller than the previous one, increment the counter.
- After the loop, also check the boundary from the last element to the first element:
  - If the last element is greater than the first element, increment the counter.
- If the counter is more than 1, it means there are multiple "drops" and the array cannot be a rotated sorted array; return false.
- Otherwise, return true.

**Key points:**  
- The array is allowed a maximum of one point where the next element is smaller than the previous one (the rotation point).  
- This simple linear scan approach ensures O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space.  
- The edge case where the input array is fully sorted and not rotated (count=0) is also handled since count â‰¤ 1 is allowed.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

5. **Java Conversion:**

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Checks if the given array is a rotated version of a sorted non-decreasing array.
     * @param nums The input array of integers.
     * @return true if array is rotated sorted, false otherwise.
     */
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Count every drop in order
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        // Check the boundary condition between last and first element
        if (nums[nums.length - 1] > nums) {
            count++;
        }
        // Array is valid if there is at most one drop point
        return count <= 1;
    }

    // Example usage and testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        int[] example1 = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(sol.check(example1)); // Expected: true

        int[] example2 = {2, 1, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.check(example2)); // Expected: false
    }
}
