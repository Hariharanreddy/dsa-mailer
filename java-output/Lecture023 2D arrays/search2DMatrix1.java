1. **What the Code Solves:**

The given C++ code implements a solution to the **"Search in a 2D Matrix"** problem. It performs an efficient search for a target integer in a 2D matrix where the matrix rows are sorted, and the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an `m x n` matrix where each row is sorted in ascending order, and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row, write an efficient algorithm to determine if a given target integer exists in the matrix.

The matrix can be visualized as a sorted list of numbers when read row-wise from left to right, top to bottom. Your task is to search for the target integer with less than O(m*n) complexity.

**Context / Relevance:**  
This problem is common in technical interviews and competitive programming because it tests understanding of efficient search algorithms, especially how to apply binary search to 2D structures by mapping 2D indices to 1D. The matrix's "sorted" property enables binary search to be used instead of a naive linear search.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
```
matrix = [
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
```

Output:  
```
true
```

Explanation: Target 3 exists in the matrix at position `(0,1)`.

---

**Example 2 (Edge case):**  
Input:  
```
matrix = [
  [1, 3, 5],
  [7, 9, 11]
]
target = 6
```

Output:  
```
false
```

Explanation: Target 6 does not exist in the matrix.

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- Since the 2D matrix is "sorted" in a way that the rows themselves are sorted and the start of each row is greater than the end of the previous, we can treat it as a single sorted 1D array of size `m*n`.
- Use **binary search** on this "virtual" 1D array:
  - Calculate the `mid` index as `(start + end) / 2`.
  - Convert the 1D `mid` index back to 2D indices via `row = mid / n` and `col = mid % n`.
  - Compare the matrix element at `(row, col)` with the target.
  - If matched, return true.
  - If the element is less than target, search in the right half.
  - Otherwise, search in the left half.
- Exit when `start` surpasses `end`, meaning the target is not found.

**Techniques Used:**  
Binary search adapted to 2D indexing, O(log(m*n)) time complexity.

**Time Complexity:**  
O(log(m*n)) â€” binary search on the entire matrix treated as a sorted array.

                start = mid + 1;          // search right half
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;            // search left half

        return false;                      // target not found
