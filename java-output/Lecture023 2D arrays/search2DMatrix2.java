1. **What the Code Solves:**
The code solves the problem of searching for a target value in a 2D matrix where each row is sorted in ascending order from left to right, and each column is sorted in ascending order from top to bottom. This is a classic **"Search a 2D Matrix II"** problem.

2. **Problem Description:**
Given an `m x n` matrix where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, determine if a given target number exists in the matrix. You need to return `true` if the target is found, and `false` otherwise.

This problem is common in algorithms and data structures courses and often appears in competitive programming and technical interviews. It tests understanding of matrix traversal and efficient search techniques, since a na√Øve approach checking every element would be inefficient (O(m*n)).

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1, 4, 7, 11],
  [2, 5, 8, 12],
  [3, 6, 9, 16],
  [10,13,14,17]
]
target = 5

Output: true
```
Explanation: 5 is present at matrix[1][1].

Example 2:
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1, 4, 7, 11],
  [2, 5, 8, 12],
  [3, 6, 9, 16],
  [10,13,14,17]
]
target = 15

Output: false
```
Explanation: 15 does not exist in the matrix.

4. **Logic Explanation (Step-by-step):**

- Start from the top-right corner of the matrix (row 0, last column).
- Compare the element at the current position with the target.
- If the element equals the target, return `true`.
- If the element is less than the target, move *down* to the next row because all elements left to the current are smaller (since the row is sorted), so only going down can possibly find a larger number.
- If the element is greater than the target, move *left* to the previous column because all elements below are larger, so only moving left can find a smaller number.
- Continue this process until you either find the target or go outside the bounds of the matrix.
- If you exhaust possible positions without finding the target, return `false`.

**Key points:**
- This approach works in O(m + n) time, much more efficient than scanning every element.
- It leverages the sorted properties of the matrix for pruning the search space.

5. **Java Conversion:**

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Search a target value in a sorted 2D matrix.
     *
     * @param matrix sorted 2D matrix with ascending rows and columns
     * @param target value to search
     * @return true if target found, else false
     */
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int rows = matrix.length;
        if (rows == 0) return false; // Edge case: empty matrix
        int cols = matrix.length;

        int row = 0;
        int col = cols - 1; // Start from top-right corner

        while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
            int element = matrix[row][col];

            if (element == target) {
                return true; // Found the target
            }

            if (element < target) {
                row++; // Move down to find larger elements
            } else {
                col--; // Move left to find smaller elements
            }
        }
        return false; // Target not found
    }

    // For testing the code (optional)
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] matrix1 = {
                {1, 4, 7, 11},
                {2, 5, 8, 12},
                {3, 6, 9, 16},
                {10,13,14,17}
        };
        int target1 = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.searchMatrix(matrix1, target1)); // true

        int target2 = 15;
        System.out.println(solution.searchMatrix(matrix1, target2)); // false
    }
}
