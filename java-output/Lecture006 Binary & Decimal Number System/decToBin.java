1. **What the Code Solves:**

This code converts a given decimal integer into its binary representation expressed as a decimal number. Essentially, it reads an integer \( n \), extracts its binary bits, and forms an integer whose digits correspond to the bits of \( n \) in binary (but stored as a decimal integer).

2. **Problem Description:**

**Convert a Decimal Number to its Binary Representation as a Decimal Integer**

Given a non-negative integer \( n \), convert it from decimal to binary. Instead of returning a string or a binary data type, output the binary number as an integer whose digits are 0s and 1s representing the binary bits of \( n \).

For example, the decimal number 5 (which is \( 101_2 \)) should be converted to the integer 101 (one hundred and one in decimal), *not* the integer 5.

This problem is a classical bit manipulation exercise useful for understanding bitwise operations and binary number representations, frequently seen in competitive programming and technical interviews.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input: 13  
Binary representation of 13 = 1101 (in binary)  
Output: 1101 (decimal number formed by digits 1,1,0,1)

Example 2 (Edge case - zero):  
Input: 0  
Output: 0

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Initialize an answer integer to 0 and a counter \( i = 0 \).
- While \( n \) is not zero:
  - Extract the least significant bit (LSB) of \( n \) by `n & 1`.
  - Multiply the bit by \( 10^i \) and add to the `ans`. This places the bit in the correct decimal position corresponding to the binary digit \( i \).
  - Right shift \( n \) by 1 to process the next bit.
  - Increment \( i \) to move to the next decimal place.
- When the loop ends, `ans` contains the binary digits of \( n \) interpreted as a decimal number.

**Patterns/Techniques:**
- Uses **bitwise operations** to extract bits.
- Constructs the output number by placing bits in decimal positions using powers of 10.
- Avoids converting to string or arrays for bit storage.

**Optimizations/Gotchas:**
- Using `pow(10, i)` for each bit could lead to floating point inaccuracies and performance issues; it's better to use an integer multiplier that scales by 10 iteratively.
- The approach fails if the binary number is too long since representing it as an integer could overflow.
- For \( n=0 \), the loop does not run â€” handle zero as a special case if needed.

**Time Complexity:**  
\( O(\log n) \), since it iterates once per bit in the binary representation of \( n \).

5. **Java Code:**

public class DecimalToBinaryDecimal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        // Special case for zero
        if (n == 0) {
            System.out.println("Answer is 0");
            return;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        int place = 1; // multiplier for decimal place (like 10^i)

        while (n != 0) {
            int bit = n & 1; // extract LSB
            ans += bit * place; // add the bit at the correct decimal place
            n >>= 1; // shift right to process next bit
            place *= 10; // move to next decimal place
        }

        System.out.println("Answer is " + ans);
    }
}

This Java program reads an integer, converts it to the binary representation treated as a decimal integer, and prints the result. It uses iterative multiplication by 10 to handle decimal place value efficiently and cleanly.
