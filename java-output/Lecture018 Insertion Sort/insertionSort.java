1. **What the Code Solves:**
   The provided C++ code implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm, a classic sorting technique used in data structures and algorithms.

2. **Problem Statement:**
   Given an array (or list) of integers, the task is to sort the array in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm. This involves iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position relative to elements before it, thereby building a sorted prefix of the array step by step.

   This problem is fundamental in understanding sorting algorithms, which are essential in computer science for organizing data efficiently. Insertion Sort is particularly relevant in competitive programming for small datasets or nearly sorted data due to its simplicity and decent performance on such inputs.

3. **Examples:**

   Example 1 (Typical case):  
   Input: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5]  
   Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 9]

   Example 2 (Edge case: already sorted array):  
   Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
   Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4. **Logic Explanation:**
   - Start from the second element (index 1), because a single element array (index 0) is trivially sorted.
   - Store the current element in a temporary variable.
   - Compare this element with all previous elements from right to left.
   - Shift all elements that are greater than the current element one position to the right.
   - Insert the current element into the position where the left element is less than or equal to it.
   - Repeat this process for all elements.
   
   Key points:  
   - This is an **in-place**, **stable** sorting algorithm.  
   - It uses a nested loop: the outer loop iterates through elements, the inner loop shifts larger elements.  
   - Time Complexity: Worst and average case O(nÂ²), Best case (already sorted) O(n).  

5. **Java Code:**

public class InsertionSort {

    // Method to perform insertion sort on the array
    public static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int temp = arr[i]; // The element to be inserted
            int j = i - 1;

            // Shift elements of the sorted segment forward to find correct position
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > temp) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]; // Shift element rightward
                j--;
            }

            arr[j + 1] = temp; // Insert element at correct position
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] example1 = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5};
        insertionSort(example1);
        System.out.print("Sorted example1: ");
        for (int num : example1) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();

        int[] example2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        insertionSort(example2);
        System.out.print("Sorted example2: ");
        for (int num : example2) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
