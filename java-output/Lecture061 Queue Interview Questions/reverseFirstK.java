1. **What the Code Solves:**

The code solves the problem of **reversing the first K elements of a queue** while leaving the rest of the queue unchanged.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given a queue of integers and an integer K, reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, and leave the rest of the elements in their original order. The queue should be modified in-place or returned after modification.

**Context:**  
This problem is common in data structure manipulation exercises and is important for understanding queue and stack operations along with basic data structure transformations. It is often asked in coding interviews and competitive programming as it tests knowledge of both stack and queue behaviors and how to simulate one with the other.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
Queue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], K = 3  
Output:  
[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]

Explanation: The first 3 elements (1, 2, 3) are reversed and the rest (4, 5) remain the same.

**Example 2 (Edge Case):**  
Input:  
Queue = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], K = 5  
Output:  
[50, 40, 30, 20, 10]

Explanation: When K equals the queue size, the entire queue is reversed.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Use a **stack** to reverse the order of the first K elements.
- Steps:
  1. Dequeue the first K elements from the queue and push them onto the stack. This reverses their order because the stack is LIFO.
  2. Pop all elements from the stack and enqueue them back into the queue. Now the first K elements are reversed.
  3. Since the remaining elements are still after the reversed elements but in the original queue, dequeue (size of queue - K) elements and enqueue them back to the end of the queue to maintain their order.
- This approach leverages the LIFO nature of stack and FIFO of queue to achieve the required reversal.
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the queue. Each element is pushed, popped, or enqueued/dequeued a constant number of times.

5. **Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.Stack;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReverseFirstKElementsOfQueue {

    /**
     * Reverses the first k elements of the queue.
     * @param queue The original queue of integers.
     * @param k Number of elements to reverse from the front.
     * @return The modified queue with first k elements reversed.
     */
    public static Queue<Integer> modifyQueue(Queue<Integer> queue, int k) {
        if (queue == null || k > queue.size() || k < 0)
            return queue; // Edge cases: invalid k or null queue
        
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        // Step 1: Dequeue first k elements and push to stack
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            stack.push(queue.poll());
        }
        
        // Step 2: Pop from stack and enqueue back to queue (reversed order)
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            queue.offer(stack.pop());
        }
        
        // Step 3: Move the remaining elements (size-k) to the back to maintain order
        int t = queue.size() - k;  // Number of elements not reversed
        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
            queue.offer(queue.poll());
        }
        
        return queue;
    }

    // Main method with I/O handling to test functionality
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = scanner.nextInt(); // Number of test cases

        while (t-- > 0) {
            int n = scanner.nextInt();
            int k = scanner.nextInt();

            Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                queue.offer(scanner.nextInt());
            }

            Queue<Integer> result = modifyQueue(queue, k);

            // Print the modified queue
            while (!result.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.print(result.poll() + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program reflects the same logic as the provided C++ code but uses Java's `Queue` (implemented by `LinkedList`) and `Stack` classes with well-structured methods and comments, ready for compilation and execution.
