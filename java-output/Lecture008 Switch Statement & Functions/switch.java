1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code snippet demonstrates how the `switch` statement works with integer and character cases, specifically exploring the behavior of switching on an integer expression and matching cases by integer constants and character literals. It mainly addresses understanding of **control flow with switch-case statements and type equivalence in switches**.

2. **Problem Description:**

Write a program that outputs different text based on the evaluation of a switch case statement. The switch expression evaluates an arithmetic expression involving variables, and case labels use both integer literals and character literals. The objective is to understand how values and types are matched in a switch statement and how nested switches can operate.

This concept is essential in learning control flow in programming, especially handling multiple conditional branches efficiently. It is commonly tested in beginner to intermediate programming interviews and competitive programming to check understanding of switches, data types (char vs int), and case handling.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 - Given the provided variables `ch = '1'` (a char representing '1') and `num = 1` (an int), and the switch expression `2 * num`:
```
Input:
num = 1

Output:
First
 First again

Explanation: The switch expression evaluates to 2, matching `case 2`.
```

Example 2 - If the `num` is changed to a value such that `2 * num` does not match `2` or `'1'`, say `num = 3`:
```
Input:
num = 3

Output:
 It is default case

Explanation: The switch evaluates to 6, which does not match any case, so the default case executes.
```

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- The switch statement takes the value `2 * num` (which is an integer).
- It compares this result with its case labels: `case 2`, `case '1'`.
- Note that `'1'` is a character literal whose ASCII value is 49, so the expression `2 * num` would have to be 49 to match this case, which is not the case here.
- Since `num` is `1`, `2 * num` evaluates to `2`, matching the `case 2` block.
- The program prints two lines: `"First"` and `" First again "`, then breaks out of the switch.
- The nested switch inside `case '1'` is not executed in this run.
- If no case matches, the default case executes.
- Time complexity is **O(1)** since a switch-case is a constant time control structure.

5. **Java Code Conversion:**

```java
public class SwitchCaseExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char ch = '1';
        int num = 1;

        System.out.println();

        switch (2 * num) {
            case 2:
                System.out.println("First");
                System.out.println(" First again ");
                break;

            case '1':  // '1' has ASCII value 49
                switch (num) {
                    case 1:
                        System.out.println("Value of num is " + num);
                        break;
                }
                break;

            default:
                System.out.println("It is default case");
        }

        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

**Notes about the Java code:**
- Java switch works similarly to C++.
- Character literals in case labels are interpreted as their Unicode integer value.
- Using `System.out.println()` for output.
- Variables `ch` and `num` retain the same meaning.
- The nested switch demonstrates multi-level conditional handling in Java.

This translation preserves logic, handles typing correctly, and follows Java best practices.
