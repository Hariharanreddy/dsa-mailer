1. **What the Code Solves:**  
The code solves the problem of **determining if a given integer is even or odd**.

2. **Problem Description:**  
Given an integer input, determine whether the number is even or odd. The program should output a message indicating "Number is Even" if the input is even or "Number is Odd" if it is odd. This is a fundamental problem in programming and is widely used in various algorithms, conditional logic checks, and real-world applications such as validating parity, distributing tasks, or alternating operations.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical case):  
Input: 10  
Output:  
Number is Even

Example 2 (Edge case: negative number):  
Input: -7  
Output:  
Number is Odd

Example 3 (Edge case: zero, which is even):  
Input: 0  
Output:  
Number is Even

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- The core concept used is bitwise AND operation with 1 (`a & 1`).
- If the least significant bit (LSB) is 1, the number is odd; otherwise, it is even.
- Steps:
  1. Read the integer input.
  2. Apply bitwise AND with 1.
  3. If the result is 1, the number is odd.
  4. If the result is 0, the number is even.
- This works because in binary representation, odd numbers always have the LSB set as 1, and even numbers have LSB as 0.
- This method is efficient and faster than using modulo operator `%` for checking even/odd.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1), as it is a single bitwise operation.

5. **Java Code Implementation:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EvenOddChecker {

    // Method to check if a number is even
    private static boolean isEven(int number) {
        // Uses bitwise AND operation to determine parity
        return (number & 1) == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int num = scanner.nextInt();

        if (isEven(num)) {
            System.out.println("Number is Even");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is Odd");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program reads an integer, checks if it is even using a bitwise operation, and prints the appropriate message. It follows good conventions such as method abstraction, proper naming, and resource management (closing scanner).
