1. **What the Code Solves:**

The code implements a **Prime Number Check** — it determines whether a given integer is a prime number.

2. **Problem Statement:**

Given an integer \( n \), determine if it is a **prime number**. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The program should output if \( n \) is prime or not. This basic problem is fundamental in number theory and is often used in algorithmic challenges, cryptography, and computer science education as a stepping stone to more complex problems involving primes.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1  
Input: 7  
Output: "is a Prime number"  
Explanation: 7 is only divisible by 1 and 7, so it is prime.

Example 2  
Input: 10  
Output: "Not a prime number"  
Explanation: 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, so it is not prime.

Example 3 (Edge case)  
Input: 1  
Output: "Not a prime number"  
Explanation: By definition, 1 is not considered a prime number.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- Start checking divisibility for the number \( n \) from 2 up to \( n-1 \).
- If \( n \) is divisible by any number in this range, it is **not prime**.
- If no divisors are found, it is a **prime number**.
- **Optimization Note:** Although the given code checks up to \( n-1 \), it is more efficient to check only up to \(\sqrt{n}\) because a larger factor of \( n \) must be paired with a smaller one which would have appeared earlier.
- The current implementation uses a simple for-loop and has a time complexity of \( O(n) \).
- An optimized approach reduces this to \( O(\sqrt{n}) \).

5. **Java Conversion:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrimeChecker {

    // Method to check if a number is prime
    private static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return false; // 1 and below are not prime
        }
        // Check divisibility only up to sqrt(n) for optimization
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return false; // divisible -> not prime
            }
        }
        return true; // no divisors found, prime
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (isPrime(n)) {
            System.out.println(n + " is a Prime number");
        } else {
            System.out.println(n + " Not a prime number");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Java version:**  
- Uses `Scanner` for input (idiomatic Java way).  
- Handles edge cases where numbers ≤ 1 return false immediately.  
- Optimizes the divisor search up to \(\sqrt{n}\).  
- Prints clear output including the input number.  
- Proper method visibility (`private static` for `isPrime`) and clean structure.
