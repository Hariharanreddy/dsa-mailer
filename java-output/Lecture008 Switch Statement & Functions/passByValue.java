## Explanation of the Code

### 1. **What the Code Solves:**
   The given C++ code snippet illustrates the concept of **pass-by-value** in C++. It demonstrates that when a variable is passed to a function, only its copy is modified within the function, not the original variable.

### 2. **Describe the Problem:**
   Given a program that takes an integer input from the user and demonstrates how passing this integer to a function affects its value. The problem statement is: "Write a program that shows the difference between the original variable and its copy modified by a function."

   **Context:** This problem is relevant in understanding parameter passing in programming languages, a fundamental concept in Data Structures and Algorithms. It helps in understanding how variables behave when passed to functions.

### 3. **Show Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     **Input:** `n = 5`
     **Output:**
     ```
     n is 6
     number n is 5
     ```
   - **Example 2:**
     **Input:** `n = 10`
     **Output:**
     ```
     n is 11
     number n is 10
     ```

### 4. **Explain the Logic:**
   - **Logic Points:**
     1. **Input and Initialization:** The program starts by reading an integer `n` from the user.
     2. **Pass-by-Value:** When `n` is passed to the `dummy` function, only a copy of `n` is increased by 1. The original `n` remains unchanged.
     3. **Output:** The modified copy of `n` is printed inside the `dummy` function, and the original `n` is printed after the function call.
     4. **Technique:** This demonstrates the pass-by-value parameter passing mechanism.
     5. **Optimization/Gotcha:** Be aware that in C++, passing large objects by value can be inefficient. Consider using pass-by-reference or passing pointers instead for such cases.
   - **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(1) because the operations performed are constant time.

### 5. **Convert to Java:**

Here is the equivalent Java code for the given C++ program:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PassByValueExample {
    public static void dummy(int n) {
        n++; // Incrementing the copy of n
        System.out.println("n is " + n);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        dummy(n);
        System.out.println("number n is " + n);
        scanner.close(); // Closing the scanner to prevent resource leak
    }
}
```
This Java code does the same thing as the original C++ code, demonstrating the pass-by-value concept. Note that Java only supports pass-by-value, unlike C++ which supports both pass-by-value and pass-by-reference (using pointers or references).
