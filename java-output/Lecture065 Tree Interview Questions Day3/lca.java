1. **What the Code Solves:**

This code implements the algorithm to find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes in a binary tree.

2. **Problem Description:**

**Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree**

Given a binary tree and two node values, find the node that is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes in the tree. The LCA is defined as the deepest node in the tree that has both nodes as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

This problem is a classic in Data Structures & Algorithms, fundamental in tree-based computations such as network routing, taxonomy, and hierarchy processing. It also frequently appears in coding interviews and competitive programming.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1 (Typical case):

Input tree (level order): 3 5 1 6 2 0 8 N N 7 4  
Nodes: 5, 1  
Output: 3

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3 (root).

---

Example 2 (One node is ancestor of the other):

Input tree (level order): 3 5 1 6 2 0 8 N N 7 4  
Nodes: 5, 4  
Output: 5

Explanation: Node 5 is an ancestor of 4, so LCA is 5.

---

Example 3 (Edge case â€” nodes not present):

Input tree: 1 2 3  
Nodes: 4, 5  
Output: No common ancestor / NULL (depends on implementation)

(Though the given code doesn't explicitly handle missing nodes by return error, it returns NULL.)

---

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- If the current node is NULL, return NULL (base case).
- If the current node's data matches either of the two values, return the current node.
- Recursively search for the two values in the left and right subtrees.
- If both left and right recursive calls return non-NULL, it means one value was found in each subtree, so the current node is their LCA.
- If only one side returns non-NULL, propagate that node upwards (meaning both nodes are located in one subtree).
- If both sides return NULL, return NULL.

This uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and recursion on the binary tree.

**Time complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once.

5. **Java Version:**

```java
import java.util.*;

// Class representing a binary tree node
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;

    Node(int val) {
        this.data = val;
        this.left = this.right = null;
    }
}

public class LowestCommonAncestor {

    // Function to find LCA of n1 and n2 in given binary tree rooted at 'root'
    public Node lca(Node root, int n1, int n2) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }

        // If current node matches either n1 or n2, this node could be LCA
        if (root.data == n1 || root.data == n2) {
            return root;
        }

        // Recur for left and right subtrees
        Node leftLca = lca(root.left, n1, n2);
        Node rightLca = lca(root.right, n1, n2);

        // If one key is found in left subtree and the other in right subtree, root is LCA
        if (leftLca != null && rightLca != null) {
            return root;
        }

        // Otherwise return non-null child if any
        return (leftLca != null) ? leftLca : rightLca;
    }

    // Utility function to build the tree from level order input
    // 'N' represents null node
    public Node buildTree(String[] nodes) {
        if (nodes.length == 0 || nodes[0].equals("N")) {
            return null;
        }

        Node root = new Node(Integer.parseInt(nodes[0]));
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        int i = 1;
        while (!queue.isEmpty() && i < nodes.length) {
            Node current = queue.poll();

            // Left child
            if (!nodes[i].equals("N")) {
                current.left = new Node(Integer.parseInt(nodes[i]));
                queue.offer(current.left);
            }
            i++;
            if (i >= nodes.length) break;

            // Right child
            if (!nodes[i].equals("N")) {
                current.right = new Node(Integer.parseInt(nodes[i]));
                queue.offer(current.right);
            }
            i++;
        }
        return root;
    }

    // Main method to test the LCA implementation
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt(); // number of test cases
        sc.nextLine();

        while (t-- > 0) {
            int a = sc.nextInt();
            int b = sc.nextInt();
            sc.nextLine();

            String treeLine = sc.nextLine();
            String[] nodes = treeLine.split(" ");

            LowestCommonAncestor solver = new LowestCommonAncestor();
            Node root = solver.buildTree(nodes);

            Node lcaNode = solver.lca(root, a, b);
            if (lcaNode != null) {
                System.out.println(lcaNode.data);
            } else {
                System.out.println("No common ancestor found");
            }
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}

**Key notes about Java translation:**
- Java does not have pointers, so we use references to objects (`Node`).
- Tree is built using a queue for level order insertion, accepting "N" strings as null.
- `main` uses `Scanner` for input, consistent with Java conventions.
- Comments provide clarity on trickier sections (e.g., early return, recursion base case).
- The solution logic remains identical in structure to C++ but uses Java classes and data structures idiomatically.
