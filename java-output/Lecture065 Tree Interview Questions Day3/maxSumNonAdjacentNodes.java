1. **What the Code Solves:**

The code solves the **"Maximum sum of non-adjacent nodes in a binary tree"** problem. Specifically, it finds the maximum sum of values of nodes such that no two nodes selected as part of the sum are directly connected as parent and child.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given a binary tree where each node contains an integer value, find the maximum sum of node values you can obtain by selecting nodes such that **no two selected nodes are directly connected (i.e., no parent-child pairs are both chosen)**.

This problem is a variant of the classic "House Robber" problem generalized to trees. It has practical applications in scheduling tasks where dependencies exist (e.g., you cannot perform dependent tasks simultaneously) or in scenarios where choosing directly linked elements is forbidden. It is also a notable example of using **tree dynamic programming (DP)** in competitive programming and interviews.

3. **Examples:**

- Example 1:
```
Input:      
        10
       /  \
      1    2

Output: 12

Explanation:
Choosing root (10) + leaf nodes none (since they are adjacent)
Or choosing 1 + 2 = 3
Maximum sum = max(10, 3) = 12
```

- Example 2 (edge case — skewed tree):
```
Input:      
       10
         \
          20
            \
             30

Output: 40

Explanation:
If we select 10 and 30, they are not adjacent.
Sum = 10 + 30 = 40
If we select 20 alone, sum = 20
Maximum sum = 40
```

4. **Logic Explained:**

- Use a **recursive post-order traversal** (bottom-up approach) of the binary tree.
- For each node, compute two values:

  1. **Include the current node’s value:** If you include the current node, then you **must exclude its children** (to avoid adjacency).
  2. **Exclude the current node:** If you exclude the current node, then you are free to **include or exclude the children based on whichever yields the maximum** sum from the children.

- Maintain a pair or two-element structure for each node where:
  - `first` = max sum including the current node.
  - `second` = max sum excluding the current node.

- Combine results:
  - `first` = node value + sums of excluding left and right children.
  - `second` = max(include left, exclude left) + max(include right, exclude right).

- The answer for the root node will be the maximum of these two values.

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to recursion stack.

5. **Java Conversion:**

```java
import java.util.*;

// Node class representing a binary tree node
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

class Solution {
    // Helper class to hold two values:
    // first - max sum including current node
    // second - max sum excluding current node
    private static class Pair {
        int include;
        int exclude;

        Pair(int include, int exclude) {
            this.include = include;
            this.exclude = exclude;
        }
    }

    // Function to compute maximum sum of non-adjacent nodes
    private Pair solve(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new Pair(0, 0);
        }

        // Recurse on left and right subtree
        Pair left = solve(root.left);
        Pair right = solve(root.right);

        // Include current node's value, exclude its children
        int include = root.data + left.exclude + right.exclude;

        // Exclude current node, children might be included or excluded for max sum
        int exclude = Math.max(left.include, left.exclude) + Math.max(right.include, right.exclude);

        return new Pair(include, exclude);
    }

    // Public method to get the maximum sum
    public int getMaxSum(Node root) {
        Pair result = solve(root);
        return Math.max(result.include, result.exclude);
    }
}

// Optional driver code for testing
public class MaxSumNonAdjacentNodes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
            Construct example tree:
                  10
                 /  \
                1    2
         */
        Node root = new Node(10);
        root.left = new Node(1);
        root.right = new Node(2);

        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.getMaxSum(root)); // Output: 12

        /*
            Construct second example (skewed tree):
                  10
                    \
                     20
                       \
                        30
         */
        Node root2 = new Node(10);
        root2.right = new Node(20);
        root2.right.right = new Node(30);

        System.out.println(solution.getMaxSum(root2)); // Output: 40
    }
}
```

- This Java version models the binary tree, uses a helper `Pair` class to return two values at once, and implements the same logic clearly.
- The `main` method includes two example test cases matching the examples above.
- Good practices: private helper method, clearly named classes and variables, and Java standard I/O conventions.
