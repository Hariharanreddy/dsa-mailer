## 1. Explain What the Code Solves

**Problem Addressed:**  
The code checks whether a given string of brackets—comprising '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']'—is **balanced** (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly nested closing bracket). This is a classic **stack-based validation** problem, often referred to as **Valid Parentheses** or **Balanced Brackets** in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 2. Problem Statement

**Standalone Problem Statement:**  
Given a string consisting only of parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, write a function that determines if the parentheses are balanced.  
A string is balanced if every opening bracket ('(', '{', '[') has a matching and correctly nested closing bracket (')', '}', ']').  
For example, the string "([]){}" is balanced, but "({[)]}" is not.

**Relevance:**  
This problem is fundamental for parsing expressions in programming languages and markup validation. It is a classic interview question for testing basic understanding of stacks and handling nested structures[4].

## 3. Examples

**Example 1 (Balanced):**  
**Input:** "([]){}"  
**Output:** true

**Example 2 (Unbalanced):**  
**Input:** "({[)]}"  
**Output:** false

**Edge Case (Empty String):**  
**Input:** ""  
**Output:** true (an empty string is considered balanced)

**Edge Case (Unmatched Opening):**  
**Input:** "(([{}])"  
**Output:** false

## 4. Logic and Time Complexity

**Solution Logic (Step-by-Step):**

- **Stack Usage:** Use a stack to keep track of the most recently seen opening bracket.
- **Iterate Through Characters:** For each character in the string:
  - **Opening Bracket:** Push it onto the stack.
  - **Closing Bracket:** Check if it matches the top of the stack (the most recent opening bracket). If it does, pop the stack; if not, the string is unbalanced.
  - **Premature Closing:** If a closing bracket is encountered with no corresponding opening bracket on the stack, the string is unbalanced.
- **Final Check:** After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, all brackets are balanced; otherwise, there are unmatched opening brackets.
- **Optimizations/Gotchas:**  
  - Early termination on mismatch improves efficiency for unbalanced strings.
  - Only three bracket types are handled.
  - Only valid characters are expected in practice.
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string, because each character is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case (all opening brackets), but often much less.

## 5. Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class BalancedParentheses {

    // Function to check if a string of brackets is balanced
    public static boolean isValidParenthesis(String expression) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < expression.length(); i++) {
            char c = expression.charAt(i);

            // Push opening brackets onto the stack
            if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[') {
                stack.push(c);
            }
            // Check for closing brackets
            else {
                // If stack is empty, there's no matching opening bracket
                if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                    return false;
                }

                char top = stack.peek();
                // Pop stack if bracket types match
                if ((c == ')' && top == '(') || 
                    (c == '}' && top == '{') || 
                    (c == ']' && top == '[')) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
                else {
                    // Mismatched bracket type
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        // If stack is empty, all brackets were matched
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String test1 = "([]){}";
        String test2 = "({[)]}";
        System.out.println(isValidParenthesis(test1)); // Output: true
        System.out.println(isValidParenthesis(test2)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

- **Java Differences:**  
  - Uses `Stack<Character>` instead of C++'s `stack<char>`.
  - Uses `String` class for input.
  - Main method for easy testing.
- **Commenting:**  
  - Comments explain stack logic and purpose.
  - Main method demonstrates usage with sample cases.
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Method is `static` for utility use.
  - Clear, expressive variable names.
  - Outputs directly via standard output for clarity.

This class compiles and runs as-is on any Java environment. Replace or add test cases in `main` as needed for further validation.
