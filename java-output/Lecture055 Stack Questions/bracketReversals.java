1. **What the Code Solves:**

This code solves the **"Minimum Number of Reversals to Make an Expression Balanced"** problem related to **balanced brackets** (specifically curly braces `{}`) in a string.

---

2. **Problem Description:**

Given a string consisting only of curly braces `{` and `}`, the task is to find the minimum number of reversals required to make the string balanced. A balanced string means every opening brace `{` has a corresponding closing brace `}` in correct order.

- If the string length is odd, it is impossible to balance the string, so return -1.
- The input only contains braces, and the allowed operation is to reverse a brace from `{` to `}` or vice versa.

**Context:**  
This problem is common in competitive programming and interviews to test understanding of stack usage and string manipulation for validation of balanced expressions.

3. **Examples:**

**Example 1:**

Input: `"}{{}}{{{"`

Output: `3`

Explanation: Minimum 3 reversals are needed to balance the braces.

---

**Example 2 (Edge case):**

Input: `'{{{{{{'`

Output: `3`

Explanation: All opening braces with no closing braces, since length is even, reversals needed to balance is half to change some `{` to `}`.

---

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- If the string length is odd â†’ Return `-1` immediately (impossible to balance).
- Use a stack to process each character:
  - Push `{` onto the stack.
  - For `}`, if stack top is `{`, pop it (balanced pair found).
  - Otherwise, push `}` onto stack.
- After processing, stack holds only unbalanced braces.
- Count how many `{` and `}` remain in the stack.
- The number of reversals needed to fix all unbalanced braces is:

  \[
  \text{reversals} = \left\lceil\frac{a}{2}\right\rceil + \left\lceil\frac{b}{2}\right\rceil
  \]

  where `a` = count of unmatched `}` and `b` = count of unmatched `{`.

**Key points:**

- The approach efficiently uses a stack to identify balanced pairs.
- The reversal calculation relies on pairing up the leftover unmatched braces since reversing one brace impacts balancing.
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as each character is processed once.

5. **Java Code Implementation:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Stack;

public class MinimumReversals {
    
    // Method to find minimum reversals to balance the braces string
    public static int findMinimumCost(String str) {
        // If length is odd, impossible to balance
        if (str.length() % 2 == 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        // Process each character
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            char ch = str.charAt(i);
            
            if (ch == '{') {
                stack.push(ch);
            } else { // ch == '}'
                if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '{') {
                    stack.pop(); // balanced pair found
                } else {
                    stack.push(ch);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int countOpen = 0;  // count of unmatched '{'
        int countClose = 0; // count of unmatched '}'
        
        // Count the unbalanced braces left in stack
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            if (stack.pop() == '{') {
                countOpen++;
            } else {
                countClose++;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate the minimum reversals needed
        int result = (countOpen + 1) / 2 + (countClose + 1) / 2;
        
        return result;
    }
    
    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("Enter the braces string:");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        
        int minReversals = findMinimumCost(input);
        
        if (minReversals == -1) {
            System.out.println("Impossible to balance the string.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Minimum reversals needed: " + minReversals);
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java class can be compiled and run directly. It reads input from the user and outputs the minimum reversals needed to balance the input string of braces.
