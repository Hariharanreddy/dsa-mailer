1. **What the Code Solves:**  
The given C++ code solves the **"Largest Rectangle in Histogram"** problem, a classic algorithmic problem based on stacks and array processing.

2. **Problem Statement:**  
Given an array of integers representing the heights of histogram bars (all bars are of unit width), find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the boundary of the histogram. The rectangle must be formed by contiguous bars.

**Context:**  
This problem frequently appears in coding interviews and competitive programming because it tests understanding of stacks, array traversal, and efficient computation of max/min boundary outlines. The problem has practical relevance in scenarios such as image histogram processing, skyline silhouette computations, and memory allocation blocks.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input: [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]  
Output: 10  
Explanation: The largest rectangle can be formed using bars of heights 5 and 6 (width 2), area = 5 * 2 = 10.

Example 2:  
Input: [2, 4]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: The largest rectangle is the bar with height 4 alone (width 1), area = 4.

4. **Explanation of The Logic:**

- Use two helper functions:
  - `nextSmallerElement`: For each bar, find the index of the next smaller bar on the right.
  - `prevSmallerElement`: For each bar, find the index of the previous smaller bar on the left.

- How they work:
  - Maintain a stack to keep indices of bars.
  - For `nextSmallerElement`, traverse from right to left, popping bars from the stack until you find a smaller one, then push the current index.
  - For `prevSmallerElement`, traverse from left to right with similar logic.

- Using these two arrays (`next` and `prev`):
  - For each bar at index i:
    - compute width = `next[i] - prev[i] - 1`
    - compute area = height[i] * width
  - Track the maximum area across all bars.

- The stack-based approach ensures O(n) time complexity by avoiding nested loops.

- **Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of bars.

- **Space complexity:** O(n) for the auxiliary arrays and stacks.

- **Key insight:** The problem is efficiently solved by finding boundaries of the largest rectangle that each bar can be part of, by determining the closest smaller bar indices on both sides.

5. **Java Code Equivalent:**

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class LargestRectangleHistogram {
    
    // Helper method to find indices of next smaller elements to the right
    private int[] nextSmallerElement(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(-1); // Sentinel value for boundaries
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int curr = arr[i];
            while (stack.peek() != -1 && arr[stack.peek()] >= curr) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            ans[i] = stack.peek();
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    // Helper method to find indices of previous smaller elements to the left
    private int[] prevSmallerElement(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(-1); // Sentinel value for boundaries
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int curr = arr[i];
            while (stack.peek() != -1 && arr[stack.peek()] >= curr) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            ans[i] = stack.peek();
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    // Main function to calculate largest rectangle area in histogram
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        
        int[] next = nextSmallerElement(heights);
        int[] prev = prevSmallerElement(heights);
        
        int maxArea = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int height = heights[i];
            
            // If no smaller element to the right, assume boundary at end of array
            if (next[i] == -1) {
                next[i] = n;
            }
            
            int width = next[i] - prev[i] - 1;
            int area = height * width;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
    
    // For demonstration/test
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LargestRectangleHistogram solver = new LargestRectangleHistogram();
        
        int[] input1 = {2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3};
        System.out.println("Largest Rectangle Area (Input 1): " + solver.largestRectangleArea(input1)); // Expected: 10
        
        int[] input2 = {2, 4};
        System.out.println("Largest Rectangle Area (Input 2): " + solver.largestRectangleArea(input2)); // Expected: 4
    }
}
```

This Java class `LargestRectangleHistogram` is self-contained and ready to compile and run. The `main` method demonstrates example usage with sample test cases. Comments clarify key operations and logic, following good Java style.
