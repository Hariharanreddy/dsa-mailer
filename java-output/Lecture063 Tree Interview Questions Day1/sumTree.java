## Explanation of the C++ Code

### 1. **Description of the Problem:**
   The C++ code addresses the concept of **Sum Trees**, which is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem. A Sum Tree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the node values in its left and right subtrees. For leaf nodes, the node value is considered to be the sum.

### 2. **Problem Statement:**
   Given a binary tree, determine whether it is a Sum Tree. A binary tree is considered a Sum Tree if for every node, the value of the node is equal to the sum of the values in its left and right subtrees. If a node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), then the sum of its subtrees is considered to be the value of the node itself.

### 3. **Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** Input Tree: `10(N N)`, Output: `true`. This is because the node has no children, so it is a Sum Tree.
   - **Example 2:** Input Tree: `26(10 3)`, where both children are leaf nodes. Output: `true`. The sum of the left and right children (10 + 3) equals the parent node's value (13), but in this case, the provided input does not match the expected output, indicating a potential error in the example. A correct example would be needed for a valid Sum Tree.

### 4. **Logic Explanation:**
   - **Base Case:** If the tree is empty (`root == NULL`), it is considered a Sum Tree.
   - **Leaf Node:** If a node is a leaf node, it is also a Sum Tree.
   - **Recursion:**
     1. **Iterate Through Tree:** Traverse the tree recursively.
     2. **Check Conditions:** For each node, check if the left and right subtrees are Sum Trees and if the current node's value equals the sum of its left and right subtrees' values.
     3. **Return Result:** Return a pair containing a boolean indicating whether the tree is a Sum Tree and an integer representing the sum of the current node and its children.

   - **Optimization:** The code uses a recursive approach with memoization implicitly through the recursive calls, which efficiently checks each node once.

   - **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once.

### 5. **Java Equivalent:**

Here is the Java equivalent of the C++ code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Node {
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
}

public class SumTree {
    // Utility function to create a new Tree Node
    public Node newNode(int val) {
        Node temp = new Node(val);
        temp.left = null;
        temp.right = null;
        return temp;
    }

    // Function to build tree from a string representation
    public Node buildTree(String str) {
        if (str.isEmpty() || str.equals("N")) {
            return null;
        }

        String[] ip = str.split(" ");
        Node root = newNode(Integer.parseInt(ip[0]));
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        int i = 1;
        while (!queue.isEmpty() && i < ip.length) {
            Node currNode = queue.poll();
            if (i < ip.length && !ip[i].equals("N")) {
                currNode.left = newNode(Integer.parseInt(ip[i]));
                queue.add(currNode.left);
            }
            i++;
            if (i < ip.length && !ip[i].equals("N")) {
                currNode.right = newNode(Integer.parseInt(ip[i]));
                queue.add(currNode.right);
            }
            i++;
        }
        return root;
    }

    // Recursive function to check if a tree is a Sum Tree
    public class Result {
        boolean isSumTree;
        int sum;

        public Result(boolean isSumTree, int sum) {
            this.isSumTree = isSumTree;
            this.sum = sum;
        }
    }

    public Result isSumTreeFast(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new Result(true, 0);
        }

        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return new Result(true, root.data);
        }

        Result leftAns = isSumTreeFast(root.left);
        Result rightAns = isSumTreeFast(root.right);

        boolean isLeftSumTree = leftAns.isSumTree;
        boolean isRightSumTree = rightAns.isSumTree;

        int leftSum = leftAns.sum;
        int rightSum = rightAns.sum;

        boolean condn = root.data == leftSum + rightSum;

        if (isLeftSumTree && isRightSumTree && condn) {
            return new Result(true, root.data + leftSum + rightSum);
        } else {
            return new Result(false, 0);
        }
    }

    public boolean isSumTree(Node root) {
        return isSumTreeFast(root).isSumTree;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SumTree st = new SumTree();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline left-over

        while (t-- > 0) {
            String s = scanner.nextLine();
            Node root = st.buildTree(s);
            System.out.println(st.isSumTree(root));
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- The Java code maintains the same logic as the C++ version, checking if a binary tree is a Sum Tree by ensuring that each node's value equals the sum of its children's values.
- This implementation uses a `Result` class to mimic the C++ `pair<bool, int>` functionality, which is essential for returning both a boolean indicating if the tree is a Sum Tree and an integer representing the sum of the tree nodes.
- The code includes a `buildTree` method to construct the tree from a string representation, similar to the C++ version.
- Java's lack of implicit memory management means that objects are garbage collected, so there is no need for manual memory deallocation like in C++.
- The input in the `main` method is read from the console using a `Scanner`.
