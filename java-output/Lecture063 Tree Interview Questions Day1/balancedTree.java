1. **What the Code Solves:**

This C++ code determines whether a given binary tree is **height-balanced** (commonly called the "Balanced Binary Tree" problem).

2. **Problem Description:**

**Balanced Binary Tree Problem:**  
Given a binary tree, check if it is height-balanced. A binary tree is height-balanced if for every node in the tree, the difference between the heights of its left subtree and right subtree is at most **1**. The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from that node down to a leaf.

**Context and Relevance:**  
This problem is fundamental in tree data structures, critical in maintaining balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees that ensure operations such as insert, delete, and find run in O(log n) time. In competitive programming and interviews, checking tree properties like balance tests understanding of recursion, tree traversal, and optimizations to avoid repeated computations.

3. **Examples:**

- Example 1:  
Input:  
```
      1
     / \
    2   3
   /
  4
```
Output:  
```
true
```
Explanation: The tree’s heights differ by no more than 1 at any node.

- Example 2 (Unbalanced):  
Input:  
```
      1
     /
    2
   /
  3
```
Output:  
```
false
```
Explanation: The left subtree height at the root is 2, right subtree is 0, difference is 2 > 1.

4. **Logic Explanation:**

- We define a recursive function `isBalancedFast` that:
  - Returns a pair containing:
    - `bool` indicating if the subtree is balanced
    - `int` indicating the height of the subtree
- For the base case, an empty node is balanced with height 0.
- Recursively check the left and right subtrees.
- The subtree rooted at the current node is balanced **iff**:
  - Left subtree is balanced
  - Right subtree is balanced
  - Difference between left and right subtree heights ≤ 1
- Height at current node = max(left subtree height, right subtree height) + 1.
- If balanced, return `{true, height}`, else `{false, height}` (height doesn't affect the answer for balance).
- The main `isBalanced` function returns the boolean part of the returned pair at the root.

**Key Techniques:**  
- Recursion with post-order traversal (children first, then current node)  
- Combining height calculation and balance check to achieve O(n) time complexity.

**Optimization:**  
- This algorithm runs in O(n) because it calculates height and balanced status simultaneously, avoiding the naive approach which repeatedly calculates heights resulting in O(n²) time.

public class BalancedBinaryTree {

    // Binary tree node class
    static class Node {
        int data;
        Node left, right;

        Node(int val) {
            data = val;
            left = right = null;
        }
    }

    public static class Solution {

        // Returns a pair: (isBalanced, height)
        private static class BalanceStatusWithHeight {
            boolean isBalanced;
            int height;

            BalanceStatusWithHeight(boolean isBalanced, int height) {
                this.isBalanced = isBalanced;
                this.height = height;
            }
        }

        private BalanceStatusWithHeight isBalancedFast(Node root) {
            if (root == null) {
                // Empty tree is balanced, height 0
                return new BalanceStatusWithHeight(true, 0);
            }

            BalanceStatusWithHeight left = isBalancedFast(root.left);
            BalanceStatusWithHeight right = isBalancedFast(root.right);

            boolean leftBalanced = left.isBalanced;
            boolean rightBalanced = right.isBalanced;

            // Check the height difference condition
            boolean heightDiffOk = Math.abs(left.height - right.height) <= 1;

            int currentHeight = Math.max(left.height, right.height) + 1;

            boolean currentBalanced = leftBalanced && rightBalanced && heightDiffOk;

            return new BalanceStatusWithHeight(currentBalanced, currentHeight);
        }

        public boolean isBalanced(Node root) {
            return isBalancedFast(root).isBalanced;
        }
    }

    // Example usage and simple manual tests
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*

        Node root1 = new Node(1);
        root1.left = new Node(2);
        root1.right = new Node(3);
        root1.left.left = new Node(4);

        /*

        Node root2 = new Node(1);
        root2.left = new Node(2);
        root2.left.left = new Node(3);

        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.isBalanced(root1)); // Expected: true
        System.out.println(solution.isBalanced(root2)); // Expected: false
