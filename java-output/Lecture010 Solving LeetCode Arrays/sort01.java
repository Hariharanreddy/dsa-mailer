1. **What the Code Solves:**

The C++ code solves the problem called **"Sort an array of 0s and 1s"** or sometimes known as **"Segregate 0s and 1s"**. It is a classic problem in Data Structures and Algorithms focused on array manipulation and partitioning.

2. **Problem Description:**

Given an array consisting only of 0s and 1s, the goal is to **sort the array such that all 0s come before all 1s**. The sorting should be done in-place (without using extra space) and efficiently.

This problem is important in competitive programming and coding interviews as it tests understanding of two-pointer approaches, array traversal patterns, and in-place swapping techniques. In real-world scenarios, it can represent partitioning binary data or optimizing memory by grouping similar items.

3. **Examples:**

Example 1:  
Input: arr = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Example 2 (Edge case – all zeros):  
Input: arr = [0, 0, 0, 0]  
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]

Example 3 (Edge case – all ones):  
Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 1]  
Output: [1, 1, 1, 1]

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**

- Use two pointers: **left** starting at the beginning, and **right** at the end of the array.
- Increment **left** while it points to 0 (because 0s are already correctly placed).
- Decrement **right** while it points to 1 (because 1s are already correctly placed).
- When **left** points to 1 and **right** points to 0, swap these two elements to move 0 toward the front and 1 toward the end.
- Repeat until **left** meets or crosses **right**.
- This approach ensures one pass over the array with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
  
**Key points:**  
- No additional arrays are used (in-place).  
- The pointers converge inward from opposite ends.  
- This method is similar to partition logic in sorting algorithms like QuickSort.

public class SortZeroOne {

    // Method to sort array of 0s and 1s in-place
    public static void sortZeroOne(int[] arr) {
        int left = 0;              // Start pointer
        int right = arr.length - 1; // End pointer

        while (left < right) {
            // Move left if current is already 0
            while (left < right && arr[left] == 0) {
                left++;
            }
            // Move right if current is already 1
            while (left < right && arr[right] == 1) {
                right--;
            }
            // Swap if left is 1 and right is 0
            if (left < right) {
                int temp = arr[left];
                arr[left] = arr[right];
                arr[right] = temp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    // Helper method to print the array
    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Main method to run example
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0};
        sortZeroOne(arr);
        printArray(arr);
    }
}
