1. **What the Code Solves:**

This C++ code finds the **duplicate element** in an array containing integers from 1 to n-1, where exactly one number is repeated. The core Data Structures & Algorithms concept addressed is the **"Finding the Duplicate Number"** problem using **XOR operation** technique.

---

2. **Problem Description:**

Given an integer array `arr` containing `n` elements with numbers ranging from `1` to `n-1`, exactly one number appears twice, and all others appear once. Your task is to find the duplicated number.

This problem is fundamental in interview preparation and competitive programming as it tests **array manipulation** and **bitwise operators** knowledge with a time-efficient and space-efficient solution.

---

3. **Examples:**

- **Example 1:**

  Input: arr = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]

  Output: 2

  Explanation: Number 2 repeats once in the array.

- **Example 2 (Edge Case):**

  Input: arr = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]

  Output: 3

  Explanation: Number 3 is the duplicated integer, though not in sorted order.

---

4. **Logic Explanation (Point-wise):**

- Initialize an integer `ans` to 0.
- XOR all elements of the array: since XORing a number with itself cancels out, duplicates will be highlighted when combined with a full range.
- XOR all integers from 1 to n-1 (where n is the array size).
- Since every number except the duplicate occurs once in both sets, they cancel out, leaving the duplicate number as the result.
- This technique uses properties of the XOR operator:
  - \(a \oplus a = 0\)
  - \(a \oplus 0 = a\)
  - XOR is commutative and associative.

**Optimization and Gotchas:**

- No extra space needed (O(1) space complexity).
- Single pass over the array and range (O(n) time complexity).
- Assumes exactly one duplicate.
- The array size is n, values from 1 to n-1, allowing XOR with range 1..n-1.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

5. **Java Conversion:**

public class FindDuplicateNumber {

    /**
     * Finds the duplicate number in an array containing numbers from 1 to n-1
     * with exactly one duplicate.
     * @param arr input array with one duplicated number
     * @return the duplicated number
     */
    public static int findDuplicate(int[] arr) {
        int ans = 0;

        // XOR all elements in the array
        for (int num : arr) {
            ans ^= num;
        }

        // XOR all numbers from 1 to n-1
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            ans ^= i;
        }

        return ans;
    }

    // Sample driver to test the method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] example1 = {1, 3, 4, 2, 2};
        System.out.println("Duplicate in example1: " + findDuplicate(example1)); // Output: 2

        int[] example2 = {3, 1, 3, 4, 2};
        System.out.println("Duplicate in example2: " + findDuplicate(example2)); // Output: 3
    }
}
